Summary
During 4Q2018 and 1Q2019, the Bank updated and reviewed internal rating system through recalibration of PD models and full re-estimation of
LGD models.
The interventions carried out were aimed at:
1.   update of the time series selection or PD e Danger Rate model in order to guarantee the' likely range of variability’ and 'Through the cycle’
     estimates ensuring the compliance with the regulatory legislation;
2.   a new methodology is proposed for the estimation of ELBE and the LGD Defaulted Asset in order to request the authorization to remove
     the IMI40 limitation on these issues;
3.   new approach for Incomplete Work-Out for LGDS model;
4.   exclusion of data generated by the disposals of NPE loans from RDS LGD as authorized by BCE;
5.   resolve part of the findings detected during the inspection IMI40 2015 and TRIM IMI 2017;
6.   introduce specific Margin of Conservatism in order to cover part of the uncertainty of estimation of risk parameters.
The first 3 changes are configured as an overall «material model change» and a first communication was sent to the Supervisory Authority on
28 February 2019; therefore, after the internal authorization by the CGR, pre-application package will be sent to ECB by the end of April 2019
and the formal request for «material model change» by the end of June 2019.
The model changes will be communicated to the first Board of May.
In order to verify the interventions made, the Supervisory Authority has already communicated that an on-site IMI will be carried out in the -
3Q2019.
                                                                                                                                                 2

 Following the interventions introduced, PD changes from 1.92% to 2.62% (+36%) with an impact of+ 3.544 €/mln on RWA. The greatest impact is related to the
 removal of internal past due definition, only marginally mitigated by the introduction of treatment of multiple defaults.
 The intervention on forborne exposure produces an increase of 22 bps on average PD and + 420 €/mln on RWA. Finally MOC C produces an increase of 4 bps on
 average PD (+1.38%) and of 191 €/mln on RWA (+12%).

 Impacts are estimated on december 2018 portfolio, pro-forma excluding Morgana disposal.
 Simulation ‘a’ includes interventions on model review that make LGD both PE and NPE increase significantly implying an impact of +5795 €/mln of RWA; this
 impact is mainly due to the update of the time series with worst cure and recovery rates observed in the early years, and also to the review of Danger Rate
 drivers. The removal of internal past due definition, also with the introduction of multiple default treatment (simulation ‘c’), brings back LGD PE and RWA PE to
 the as is levels (the increase of past due absorbe the increase of LGD NP on RWA PE).
 New downturn methodology implies a decrease compared to the current approach and so LGD value decreases (simulation ‘d’).
 With the inclusion of all the IWO with estimation of future recoveries (simulation ‘e’), LGD NPE increases of -2,7% with consequent increase of LGD PE
 determining a NPE shortfall level of +523 €/mln.
 New ELBE/DA approach identifies ELBE with the Long Run Average (‘f’) and brings back NPE shortfall to a negative value (-19 €/mln) and a RWA NPE value similar
 to as is. With the introduction of a vintage driver for ELBE/DA (simulation ‘g’) the impact is +341 €/mln on RWA and with the introduction of the MOC C the final
 impact is +588 €/mln (+2% c.a) on RWA.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5

Model change overall impact
    The overall impact vs pro-forma December 2018 (excluding Morgana disposal) taking into account all interventions on PD and LGD models amount
    to + 4.408 €/mln for RWA PE and -205 €/mln for RWA NPE, NPE shortfall increases from -950 €/mln to -100 €/mln. The estimated CET1% decreases
    from 13.77% to 12.84% (-93 bps). The MOC C on PD and LGD models leads to an impact of +1,5% in terms of RWA and to a decrease of 9 bps of
    CET1%.

PD-LGDDR Multiple default                                        PD4 DR4
According with the current regulation, institution shall adopt an internal methodology for the
treatment of the multiple default; in particular a period of time has to be defined in order to
recognise as a single default all the multiple default occurrences observed within that period. The
same treatment of multiple default has to be adopted for the purpose of LGD, PD .
The analyses showed that a period of 12 months captured the large part of re-default occurrences.
                                                                                                              Old definition
Consequently the Bank decided, according also with the approach required by the regulatory
guidelines, to consider a defaulted exposure that, after returning to non-defaulted status has been
classified as defaulted again within a period of time of 12 months, should be treated as constantly
defaulted from the first moment the default occurred.                                                  No specific treatment for multiple

The following tables show anchor point calculated with a 10 years and 8 months time series, after the removal of internal definition of technical past due, the
treatment of multiple defaults and the introduction of a specific treatment for forborne exposures. The interventions carried out on PD models produce an increase
of the Anchor Point, except for SME, Small SME and Multiyears models, mainly due to the removal of internal technical past due definition.

                                  The Supervised Entities use an approach aimed at classifying the forborne exposures through an ex-post rule in the calibration phase.
                                  This approach determines the exclusion of a significant share of counterparties for whom the observation period is not over yet. In
          Finding n.8             order to offset this data exclusion, the Supervised Entities defined an add-on on the PDs. Although the internal validation function
                                  expressed a positive opinion on this calibration process, a challenger model was not put in place by the internal control function to

                                  set out for this finding since the data used to calibrate the model is not fully representative of the actual exposures of the institution.

Estimation of ELBE and LGD in default with a new approach 2/3
ELBE: on the basis of the new approach, Long Run Average LGD represent the ELBE.
LGD defaulted asset: the downturn component is adopted as add-on unexpected of loss to add to ELBE in order to capture additional loss due to less recoveries observed
in a recessive period; MOC C is also included.
The estimation of ELBE/DA has the same methodological approach and reference data sets used for the estimation for non defaulted exposures (only some precaution is
taken as shown in the table below).
In ELBE/DA estimations vintage driver has been introduct with the aim to obtain a value more aligned to the recovery prospects on files with different ageing of staying in
