Description of    MPS model change 2018_3: transfer of a limited portfolio (n.280 mortages) from the
the change or     Parent Company MPS, with Airb approach, to the subsidiary Widiba, with Standard
extension         approach. Quantitative thresholds have been designed to take into account the overall
                  impact of the changes on the capital required and RWAs based on the internal
                  approaches as well as the standardised approaches, in order to reflect the change to
                  which internal approaches are used for the overall own funds requirements and risk-
                  weighted exposure amounts. In section ‘2 - Irb information’ we have reported only the
                  variation connected to Airb RWA. The verification of the quantitative criteria envisaged
                  in the internal policy (D02221), carried out with data as of 30th September 2018, has
                  confirmed the non-material classification of the intervention, as the model change has
                  determined a relative reduction of 0.07% for AIRB RWA and an increase of 0.01% for
                  total RWA: the small reduction in Airb RWA (- € 3 million) has been compensated by
                  the increase in Standard RWA for an amount of € 10 million, thereby determining an
                  overall increase in total RWA of € 7 million. Airb approach is currently adopted for
                  Corporate and Retail exposure of Banca MPS, Banca L&F e MPS CS, while Banca Widiba
                  is in roll-out by the end of 2019.
