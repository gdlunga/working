1. Foreword
  The Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process of the MPS Group represents the approach adopted by
  the Group to evaluate, manage and control liquidity risk, aiming at guaranteeing adequacy of liquidity
  resources and management processes. This document represents a synthetic but complete overview of the
  MPS ILAAP outcomes and includes the main conclusions about the actual position of the Group in terms of
  risks to liquidity and funding, liquidity adequacy and liquidity risk management and control practices. The
  MPS ILAAP outcomes is intended to act as a support for the Liquidity Adequacy Statement (LAS) containing the
  view of the management body of the Group’s liquidity adequacy.
  The first dimensions herein represented are the inherent liquidity and funding risks and the liquidity
  adequacy of the Group, including the evaluation of consistency with the RAF, regulatory and internal limits
  and the Group business strategies.
  The second dimension concerns the way liquidity and funding risks are embedded in the Group processes and
  how they are monitored and managed within the risk management and control framework.
  The evaluation of the liquidity risk position and liquidity related processes is complemented by the actions
  the Group will adopt to fix the main weaknesses and align its processes to the best practices and the
  regulatory principles.
  The reference date of this ILAAP Outcomes is 31 December 2016. However, the main features in terms of
  methodology changes and key processes evolution have been here represented – with a specific reference –
  despite in some cases the formal coming into force took place after 31 December 2016. Furthermore, the
  Group has chosen to describe the actions undertaken in defense of liquidity adequacy after the liquidity crises
  occurred in 2016, in particular the program for issuing new Government Guaranteed Bonds (GGB) from January
  2017. For this purpose, a specific paragraph has been added to the analysis of inherent risks and liquidity
  adequacy in order to represent the updated situation as of 28/02/2017 and draw the appropriate
  conclusions.
                                                                                                                2

2. Inherent risks and liquidity adequacy assessment
  This chapter focuses on the analysis of liquidity and funding position as of 2016 year end, sources of inherent
  risks and adequacy of liquidity resources to face liquidity and funding risks.
  During 2016, the liquidity position of the Group has been strongly influenced by several exceptional events,
  both systemic and specific. Through the last year the Group suffered phases of severe liquidity stress with
  events close to real bank runs that were addressed developing a specific business plan to limit the loss of
  stable funding. In particular:
    <U+F0B7>   January 2016 – following the adoption of BRRD and the resolution of four Italian banks occurred in
        November 2015, tension on Italian banking sector brought pressure on MPS stock price leading to a first
        severe deposits run-off (about -8 €/bn during 2016 first quarter);
    <U+F0B7>   July-August 2016 – following the ECB draft letter requiring the Group to massively dispose non-
        performing loans (NPL), with the consequent need for a new capital increase, and the negative outcome
        of stress test, the commercial funding of the Group was put under pressure again (about -9 €/bn during
        2016 third quarter);
    <U+F0B7>   October 2016 – the Group developed a new business plan concerning the securitization of non-
        performing loans and a capital increase on the market before the end of the year, in accordance with
        the requests of ECB;
    <U+F0B7>   December 2016 – The outcome of Italian constitutional referendum and the subsequent resignation of
        the Italian Government brought a strong uncertainty on the possibility to undertake, before the end of
        2016, the planned recapitalization and to solve the NPL issue. Such uncertainty, together with frequent
        negative media exposure, leaded the Group to a new severe liquidity stress (about -12 €/bn during 2016
        last quarter).
  Such dynamics put strong pressure on the short-term liquidity position of the Group throughout 2016, as well
  as compromised the structure of long term funding. To answer to these events of liquidity crisis, the Group
  Stress Committee was promptly called, involving the highest level of responsibility within the management,
  and the Board of Directors was kept informed with frequent updates. The main actions undertaken by the
  Stress Committee (most of which already planned within the Group Contingency Funding Plan) have been:
    <U+F0B7>   Cut rates in support of commercial funding, trying both to limit commercial outflows and gain new
        customers;
    <U+F0B7>   New issuances of covered bonds;
    <U+F0B7>   New secured funding of non-eligible assets;
    <U+F0B7>   Pledge of new credit claims in ABACO program;
    <U+F0B7>   New secured funding through ECB auctions, both long and short term.
  2.1. Liquidity and funding risk
  The liquidity and funding position of the Group has been assessed taking into account the whole span of the
  maturity ladder, from intraday to the very long-term. The analysis aims at evaluating the risk position and the
  adequacy of liquidity resources to face risks over different time horizons and under different conditions
  (normal and stressed). With reference to the time horizon, two dimensions have been evaluated, given the
  different risks that may arise from them. The first dimension, namely short term liquidity risk (typically up to
  1 year and with a specific focus up to 1 month), focuses on the ability to meet obligations as they come due,
  without incurring unacceptable losses. The intraday horizon represents a sub-dimension of the short term
  liquidity risk: it deals with the ability to withstand shocks occurring on an intraday basis, generating a
  cumulated cash need that may put into question the ability of the bank to abide by its obligations. This
                                                                                                                 3

becomes even more relevant the more the bank operates in payment and settlement systems. The second
dimension concerns the longer-term time horizon (conventionally over 1 year), with a focus on the
sustainability of the funding profile, meaning the ability to fund banking activities with stable sources of
funding. An unbalanced funding structure increases the risk of instability even in the short term.
As a matter of fact, some of the risks arising from lending and funding activities may impact on both the short
term and the structural funding profile, making these two notions inherently interconnected. Hence, for the
purpose of this assessment, liquidity risk means the short term horizon, while funding risk refers to the
longer-term, even if, for the sake of clarity, they can sometimes be used interchangeably.
2.2. Short term liquidity position
The Group adopts the maturity ladder periodically produced for supervisory reporting as a reference for short
term liquidity daily monitoring. The maturity ladder construction methodology in normal conditions is already
mildly “stressed”, considering a number of prudential assumptions on interbank market, wholesale
funding/loans renewal, institutional bonds tax repayments and non-eligible asset funding. Thus, maturity
ladder defines the time to survival “on going concern” in terms of net liquidity position.
Following the dynamic of the liquidity position and its consistency with the limit system in force:
<U+F0B7> counterbalancing capacity in normal conditions amounts to 6,9 €/bn, lower than the 8,1 €/bn set as
    contingency level; the CBC stock is enough to guarantee any short-term need in a horizon beyond 3
    months in a going concern situation, but not sufficient in a stress scenario;
<U+F0B7> as of 31/12 maturity ladder presents a 1 month net liquidity position of 6,7 €/bn, barely beyond the
    contingency level (the contingency limit is set at 6 €/bn). However, the whole maturity ladder profile
                                                                                                              4

        violates contingency limit curve. This amount of 1M net liquidity position is only equal to 4,4% of total
        MPS Group assets, far lower than 11,9% of the industry1;
    <U+F0B7> both counterbalancing capacity and 1 month net liquidity position benefit by the special actions
        determined by the Stress Committee to cope with liquidity crises, especially the pledge of new credit
        claims in ABACO program for about 2,6 €/bn (as planned within the Group Contingency Funding Plan).
    The following chart depicts the 1 Month Net Liquidity position over 2016:
    While maturity ladder defines the time to survival “on going concern” in terms of net liquidity position, the
    liquidity stress test allows the calculation of the Stressed time to survival, one of the key metrics of the RAF.
    The Group performs, on a daily basis, a liquidity stress test analysis in order to calculate the Stressed time to
    survival and to monitor the evolution of the exposure to stress events. Stresses applied on the maturity
    ladder are defined through a formal risk identification process taking place every year within the update and
    revision of stress test scenarios. This process supports the annual definition of Risk Appetite Statement and
    Liquidity Risk Limits and allows the Group to align the Liquidity Risk Framework with the evolution of market
    and institution-specific conditions.
    The following table represents the results of the Group specific liquidity stress test used as of 31/12/2016,
    with the reported impact spread all along the maturity ladder.
    The specific liquidity stress scenario is composed by:
         <U+F0B7>    a Group idiosyncratic commercial stress;
         <U+F0B7>    a Group idiosyncratic financial stress.
1
  See Banca d’Italia, Rapporto sulla stabilità finanziaria, 2/2016.
                                                                                                                    5

The commercial idiosyncratic scenario assumes:
    <U+F0B7> sight deposits run off (6% up to 1 month, with linearized decay up to 1 year according to Basel 3
         methodology);
    <U+F0B7> buy back or non-renewal of commercial own issuances (3,8% up to 1 month with further
         deterioration up to 1 year);
    <U+F0B7> non-renewal of main types of term deposits (9% flat);
    <U+F0B7> sharp draw of committed credit lines and liquidity facilities (17% up to 1 month with total absorption
         up to 1 year);
    <U+F0B7> decrease of customer’s securities lending (reducing CBC by 14% up to 1 month, with total absorption
         up to 1 year).
 The financial idiosyncratic scenario assumes:
    <U+F0B7> impact on retained securities price devaluation (2% flat);
    <U+F0B7> impact of a downgrade of retained securities on the ECB haircut applied and the loss of the cash
         reserve for covered bond programs (estimated 1,6 €/bn up to 1 week, 3,7 €/bn additional up to 1
         month, 0,8 €/bn additional up to 1 year).
The composite effect of the simultaneous application of these specific stress scenarios (as of 31/12/2016) is
shown in the last row, with a total liquidity absorption within the 1 month horizon equal to about 10 €/bn
and a potential 1 year liquidity absorption equal to 19,3 €/bn.
Alongside specific stress scenarios, the Group also calculates the impact of a generic scenario, further
composed (as of 31/12/2016) by:
    <U+F0B7>    Italian sovereign systemic stress;
    <U+F0B7>    market systemic stress with counterparty defaults.
                                                                                                            6

The Italian sovereign systemic stress, impacting all along the maturity ladder, assumes:
     <U+F0B7> “Italian government bonds devaluation”: market value impact on CBC and required collateral need
         for derivatives and repos caused by an increase around 200 bps of the Italian/German government
         bonds spread (amounting to 1,8 €/bn flat);
     <U+F0B7> “Downgrade by all rating Agencies of government bond rating”: modification of liquidity value in
         function of an haircut increase (amounting to 1,1 €/bn flat).
The market systemic stress scenario, also impacting all along the maturity ladder, assumes:
     <U+F0B7> “Derivatives and securities adverse market”: impact of adverse market conditions on derivatives and
         securities valuation (stressing specific risk factors, resulting in a total that for current portfolio
         amounts to around 0,6 €/bn flat);
     <U+F0B7> “Financial guarantees”: impact from enforcement of financial guarantees (absorbing 1,2 €/bn flat).
The composite effect of the simultaneous application of these generic scenarios, as of 31/12/2016, amounts
to 4,8 €/bn starting from 1 day and spread up to 12 months.
The effect of the simultaneous occurrence of all the scenarios on the Group portfolio as of 31/12/2016
amounts to a 14,8 €/bn liquidity impact on the 1 month horizon, as shown in the following table:
The stressed time to survival is calculated applying the most severe scenario between the bank idiosyncratic
stress and the generic one. Here below the results of the stress test applied on the 30/12/2016 maturity
ladder.
In a stressed perspective, the available liquidity reserve brings the Group to withstand for 0 days (target level
= 60 days, operational limit = 30 days, contingency level = 14 days).
The following chart depicts the stressed time to survival over 2016:
                                                                                                               7

Alongside the managerial liquidity stress test, the Group also calculates a regulatory stressed indicator, the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (computed, starting from October 2016, according to the rules set out by the
Commission Delegated Regulation issued pursuant to Article 460 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013).
The LCR as of 31/12/2016 is at 108% calculated according to the Delegated Act rules. Target level of 120%
and operational limit of 70% are defined by 2016 Liquidity Risk Tolerance; the regulatory level at 31/12
amounts to 70%.
Following an overview of the evolution of the LCR main components over 2016:
                                                                                                             8

As the graph implies, during 2016 the worsening of LCR is deeply connected to the evolution of liquid-assets
buffer. Such negative trend is partially mitigated by the reduction of outflows, especially in December, while
the dynamic of stressed inflows is quite stable.
In particular, both January-February and July-August periods have been characterized by liquidity crises with
drastically negative commercial dynamic. In December, the strong loss of wholesale commercial funding
produced a sharp decrease of liquidity buffer, but on the other hand brought to a partial reduction of
associated outflows too (outflows rates related to wholesale funding are higher than those related to retail).
Despite the outflows fall, only the actions taken by the Stress Committee pledging new credit claims in
ABACO program to obtain new secured funding with ECB have preserved level 1 assets, avoiding the drop of
the LCR indicator.
If compared to the stressed net liquidity position represented by the stressed time to survival, well under the
contingency level, LCR is still over the fully phased-in regulatory limit of 100%. Such difference between
internal and regulatory metrics is mainly explained by the different stresses used, with the internal one more
severe than that implicit in LCR net outflows. Besides, as shown in the next paragraph, LCR liquidity buffer is
slightly higher than counterbalancing capacity because of different approaches in the determination of liquid
assets.
LCR is also calculated individually for foreign subsidiaries (Monte Paschi Banque and Monte Paschi Belgio).
LCR produced for regulatory purposes is consistent with Commission Delegated Regulation and it amounts at
194% for Monte Paschi Banque and 150% for Monte Paschi Belgio as of 31/12/2016, in both cases higher
than the 70% limit.
The buffer of liquid assets
The composition of LCR buffer, calculated according to the Delegated Regulation issued pursuant to Article
460 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, is shown in the following table (excluding adjustments related to the
application of caps according to requirements for composition of liquidity buffer under Delegated Act):
                                                                                                              9

The bulk of liquidity buffer is composed by level 1 assets (99,7% of total buffer) entailing no haircut or a
limited haircut (7% for Extremely High Quality Covered Bonds) to their market value. Of these assets, the bulk
is made by cash or cash equivalents (55%) and assets issued or guaranteed by the central government (45%).
This consideration allows the Group to judge positively its ability to liquidate assets upon stress conditions
(given the assets liquidity and broad market availability for them) even if the scarcely diversified liquid-assets
buffer (with a strong concentration in national treasury bonds) poses some questions around the
consequences of fire sales and market panic eventually unleashed by a sovereign crisis. Other residual items
(other public entities assets, other high quality covered bonds, corporate bonds and equities) represent only
a small fraction of the total buffer amount.
Some considerations about the consistency between the Liquidity Buffer produced according to regulatory
rules and the CBC used within the ongoing daily monitoring (excluding regulatory adjustments on LCR Buffer)
can be drawn, based on the reconciliation table provided below:
                                                                                                                10

The main conceptual difference is certainly due to the treatment of retained covered bonds and
securitizations. The ECB eligible assets reported in the managerial CBC, indeed, include retained covered
bonds and securitization, excluded in the regulatory stressed approach (Level 3 assets). This difference
amounts to 111 €/mln (CBC higher than Liquidity Buffer), but it could be even bigger in relation to the
unencumbered part of retained bonds in CBC. The entire part of retained structured bonds conferred to the
ECB pooling (2,9 €/bn) is entirely encumbered. It is worth recall that these securities actually represent a
source of prompt liquidity in that they are ECB eligible and can be used to obtain secured funding in the
market. It should also be underlined that they can lose their market-liquidity in time of stress if compared
with central government securities. The Group is well-aware of this and it deals with this risk by performing
specific stress scenarios and analyses taking into account downgrade or loss of eligibility for this kind of
assets. The liquidity stress test also envisages hypotheses of shocks applied on a few key items included in
the CBC, as securities lending, devaluation of retained securities, sovereign crisis (see par. 4.1 for more
details).
Other major differences are attributable to the following:
    <U+F0B7>     The LCR considers the cash available in the form of coins and banknotes (CBC lower by 0,85 €/bn),
          while excludes the mandatory reserve (CBC higher by 0,58 €/bn);
    <U+F0B7>     The CBC computes the ECB haircut on its assets, while the LCR buffer, composed largely by sovereign
          securities, does not apply any haircut, apart from residual L2 asset (CBC lower by 0,1 €/bn);
    <U+F0B7>     The Group LCR buffer also considers Liquid assets owned by foreign entities and branches, while, as
          hinted above, the CBC prudentially excludes them (CBC lower by 0,36 €/bn).
The major drivers above reported explain the 0,6 €/bn difference between the managerial Counterbalancing
Capacity and the LCR Buffer.
Intraday Liquidity position
The intraday liquidity exposure is measured through a number of tools, some of which deployed in
accordance with the Basel 3 regulatory framework. The measurement of the main liquidity risk indicators is
performed on a daily basis, while other forms of first line controls are performed more frequently.
The following figure shows the check on the daily Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) account level to
maintain according to regulatory and internal requirement:
                                                                                                           11

The check shows the respect of the daily limit as of 31/12 with the end-of-day level equal to about 3,6 €/bn
and the evidence of the dynamic over the day. The daily level to maintain was set at 2,5 €/bn, composed by
436 €/mln (minimum level for the TARGET day, set-up based on the Mandatory Reserve for the period) and
about 2,1 €/bn of additional prudential buffers (1 €/bn based on the level of 1 Month Net Liquidity Position
and 1,1 €/bn determined at discretion of the Liquidity Management Function Responsible).
Hereby a representation of the RTGS account dynamic over the mandatory reserve period that highlight the
continuous respect of the limit during 2016.
The potential daily liquidity, monitored to check the intraday counterbalancing capacity, amounts to 2,54
€/bn, close to the 2,5 €/bn operational limit. The worst intraday liquidity usage (hourly) in the last year
amounted to less than 2,4 €/bn, a result confirming the prudent approach of the Group for intraday liquidity.
The Group performs two different stress tests on intraday liquidity usage: at 31/12 the exposure was quite
important but the cash available to the treasury has always been largely over the intraday liquidity need,
even in stress conditions.
                                                                                                           12

2.3. Medium/long term liquidity position
Funding risk is primarily monitored through the regulatory indicator NSFR, which has been included within
the 2016 Risk Appetite Framework as a Key Risk Indicator.
The NSFR amounts to 87,6%, lower than the operational limit of 96% limits established for 2016, but slightly
higher than the contingency level of 86%; the dynamic over 2016 shows a steady worsening trend (-13%) due
to the liquidity crises that, as said before, brought to a very strong loss of commercial funding.
The most important events explaining this dynamic are:
 <U+F0B7>   in the first quarter of 2016 NSFR was affected by liquidity crises which lead to severe deposits run-off
     with a consequent decrease of Available Stable Funding due to loss of both retail funding (-3,8 €/mld),
     wholesale funding (-0,45 €/bn) and secured funding (-1,3 €mld). In the same period an increase of
     Required Stable Funding occurred due to a higher level of asset encumbrance (+2,2 €/bn), because the
     loss of deposits had to be replaced, at least partially, by new secured funding;
 <U+F0B7>   during the second quarter the Group restored a part of the liquidity reserves lost in the first quarter and
     consolidated liabilities structure increasing long-term funding with ECB (TLTRO auctions);
 <U+F0B7>   over the third quarter the new liquidity crisis put the structural equilibrium of the Group under pressure
     again, with a strong decrease of unsecured stable funding (retail -3,2 €/bn and wholesale -3€/bn) only
     partially limited by the increase of secured funding (+6,5 €/bn from new long-term ECB auctions). NSFR
     was also negatively affected by a capital loss due to credits devaluation required by the business plan
     for the disposal of non-performing loans, and by an increase of Required Stable Funding due to a higher
     level of encumbrance related to residential mortgages.
 <U+F0B7>   in the final quarter of 2016, with the sharpening of the liquidity crisis, there was a second loss for credits
     devaluation and a strong decrease of Available Stable Funding due to unsecured stable funding both
     from retail (-5,3 €/bn) and wholesale customers (-3,1 €/bn). Over the same period the Required Stable
     Funding showed a reduction of long term loans (-4,3 €/bn) that partially made up for the decrease of
     funding.
While NSFR measures funding risk from a regulatory point of view, Gap Ratios do the same from a managerial
perspective. The following figure shows Gap Ratios level as of 31/12/2016, compared to the internal limit
system:
                                                                                                                13

 <U+F0B7>   the Gap Ratio 1Y, calculated as [(<U+2211> outflows T > 1 year) / (<U+2211> inflows T > 1 year)], amounts to 102%, between the
     target level (112%) and the operational limit (97%); coherently with NSFR, the dynamic over 2016 has
     been worsening (109,3% as of December 2015);
 <U+F0B7>   the Gap Ratio 3Y, (calculated as [(<U+2211>outflows T > 3 year) / (<U+2211> inflows T > 3 year)], amounts to 104,8%, above the
     target level (91%); notwithstanding liquidity crises, the dynamic over 2016 has been improving (79,7%
     as of December 2015), mainly thanks to the need to replace commercial funding with long term ECB
     funding (TLTRO auctions);
 <U+F0B7>   the Commercial Gap Ratio (Commercial funding / Commercial lending) amounts to 63,3%, far lower than
     the target level (85%); the dynamic over 2016 has also been worsening (80,9% as of December 2015)
     because of the multiple negative events on commercial funding.
Alongside NSFR and Gap Ratios, the Group monitors several additional metrics related to the structure of
funding, like concentration and asset encumbrance ratios.
Here below a representation of asset encumbrance:
                                                                                                                   14

The net asset encumbrance ratio conveys an important message: as of 31/12/2016, more than 80% of total
encumberable assets is currently used to raise cash (81% from 55% at the end of 2015, well over the
operational limit of 56%), therefore the capacity to raise additional liquidity through secured funding is very
limited. Similarly the gross asset encumbrance ratio has grown with respect to 2015 with almost 49% of total
assets that have already been used to raise cash. This dynamic highlights clearly how the Group has covered
the loss of commercial deposits with secured sources of funding to face liquidity crises.
Starting from April 2016, the Group calculates and reports to the competent authorities with a monthly
frequency the Additional Liquidity Monitoring Metrics (ALMM), a set of new liquidity risk indicators defined
by European Supervisor. The ALMM aims to provide supervisory authorities a comprehensive view of the
Group liquidity risk profile through information which integrate LCR and NSFR. The ALMM package currently
includes the following templates:
     <U+F0B7>   Concentration of funding by counterparty
     <U+F0B7>   Concentration of funding by product type
     <U+F0B7>   Price of funding
     <U+F0B7>   Roll-over of funding
     <U+F0B7>   Concentration of Counterbalancing
Besides concentration templates reported within the ALMM, the Group analyzes concentration of funding
through an internal approach, which results are detailed below:
Overall, funding is not that concentrated in terms of funding channels, even if there is a significant share of
ECB funding. In terms of concentration by maturity, the next three years present a fairly important amount of
maturing issuances and other financial operations, both secured and unsecured, while ECB auctions are going
to expire by the fourth year.
Due to the persistent liquidity crisis, during 2016 the funding position of the Group presents an increasing
grade of concentration by counterpart. The largest wholesale funding provider (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti)
weights for about the 19% of total wholesale funding but can be considered less risky than a typical
wholesale counterpart due to its role of pass-through financing provider. On the other hand, CSEA, a public
entity collecting fees related to energy provision, weights for about the 17% of total wholesale funding. Other
wholesale funding providers have a negligible weight compared to the Group total funding.
Regarding currencies, the Group does not have a significant liquidity exposure in foreign currencies: the most
important currency other than Euro is the US Dollar, with a weight on total funding amounting to just 1,7%.
                                                                                                             15

2.4. Evolution of liquidity and funding position following the relevant facts occurred
        after 31/12/2016
Liquidity actions for the first quarter of 2017
As highlighted before, during 2016 several events of liquidity crises brought the Group to a deteriorated
liquidity position which was not adequate with respect to the limits set up by the previous Risk Appetite
Statement.
On 23 December 2016, as granted by the Government Law Decree n. 237, BMPS immediately started a
request for the guarantee on new bonds to be issued. The required guarantee was accepted by the
Government, with official communication to the Group on 19 January 2017. In particular, the guarantee was
granted on a maximum amount of 15 €/bn of bonds within the first half of 2017 on already fixed sizes and
maturities:
     <U+F0B7>   27 December 2016 - 1 March 2017 3 €/bn with maturity 1 year and 4 €/bn with maturity 3 years;
     <U+F0B7>   1 March 2017 - 1 June 2017 4 €/bn with maturity 3 years;
     <U+F0B7>   1 June 2017 - 31 December 2017 4 €/bn with maturity 3 years.
Thus, the Group immediately started procedures for the first issues, which led on 25 January 2017 to two
retained GGB for a total amount of 7 €/bn to be sold or used as collateral for financing operations. On 1
February 2017, the Group obtained both the quotation on the TLX market and the ECB eligibility for the new
GGB. Even if ECB eligibility is not “usable” by the Group itself, but only by external subscriber, it represents an
important element for the marketability of this instruments. Between 31 January and 6 February 2017 the
Group also obtained ratings for GGB by DBRS and Fitch.
From a commercial point of view, once the guarantee was granted by the Government, deposits run-off
gradually stopped, decreasing the pressure over liquidity reserves. After selling/funding of the new GGB (4,5
€/bn sold on the market and 2,5 €/bn financed by repos), from February 2017 the liquidity position of the
Group has significantly improved, also showing a positive commercial contribution, clear proof of a new trust
from customers.
The figure below shows the Net Liquidity Position at the end of February 2017 compared with the situation at
the end of 2016.
The main metrics show that:
<U+F0B7> the Counterbalancing capacity increased to 13 €/bn from a minimum of around 6 €/mld;
                                                                                                                 16

<U+F0B7> the 1 month net liquidity position increased to 9 €/bn, despite the 1 month time bucket is affected by the
    expiring of the old GGB for almost 4 €/bn;
<U+F0B7> the stressed time to survival significantly improved in area 30 days from 0 days as of 31/12/2016 (over 12
    months without stress);
<U+F0B7> the potential daily liquidity available intraday increased by 6 €/bn to 8,5 €/bn (2,5 €/bn as of 31/12/2016),
    above the 2,5 €/bn limit;
<U+F0B7> the LCR increased to 136% from 119% at the end of 2016, above the target level (120%);
<U+F0B7> the Gap Ratio 1Y increased to 103,1% from 102,2% (above the operational limit of 97%) and the
    Commercial Gap Ratio increased to 66% from 63,3% (closer to the operational limit of 70%);
<U+F0B7> due not only to issuing and financing of new GGB, but also to the recovering of unsecured deposits, even
    NSFR was up to 94% from the previous 88%, a level close to the operational limit (96%);
<U+F0B7> due to the reduction of secured funding, the Gross asset encumbrance ratio was down to 44,5% (limit
    30%) and the Net asset encumbrance ratio to 71,2% (limit 56%).
The liquidity funding strategy 2017-2019
The next three years are going to be a challenging period for the Group from a point of view of the liquidity
actions to undertake, especially 2017. The liquidity funding strategy 2017-2019, drawn according to the
current version of the Restructuring Plan, still under discussion with competent authorities and hence subject
to be modified, defines the guidelines of the funding of the Group over a three-year time horizon, in
compliance with the limits set up on risk indicators, both internal and regulatory.
In order to restore liquidity position to an adequate level, increase the structural funding and cope with any
worsening of the position, the liquidity funding strategy includes the following main actions for 2017:
     <U+F0B7>   New Government Guaranteed Bond (GGB) for total 11 €/bn (of which 7 €/bn already issued) are
         planned to be issued in the first half of 2017.
     <U+F0B7>   Capital increase for 4,5 €/bn of liquidity impact in the first half of 2017.
     <U+F0B7>   NPLs disposal for 6,3 €/bn of liquidity impact by the end of 2017.
     <U+F0B7>   Restoring of the commercial funding. In 2017 the net funding contribution is expected to be +5,2
         €/bn, with the aim to reduce the level of asset encumbrance.
In particular, old Government Guaranteed Bond (GGB) are expiring next March for an amount of 4 €/bn (-3,7
€/bn of counterbalancing impact). For this purpose, the first tranche of new GGB (about 6,7 €/bn of liquidity)
aims not only to support liquidity balances, but also to renew the maturing funding. Moreover, in 2017 the
Group have to start a process for eliminating the reliance of liquidity position on ECB’s short-term auctions
(MRO).
Besides, in the next years the liquidity funding strategy includes other action for reinforcing the funding
structure.
     <U+F0B7>   Renewal of unsecured issuances (new unsecured bonds for 2 €/bn against 1,8 €/bn expiring).
     <U+F0B7>   Increase of secured issuances (new covered bonds for 3,5 €/bn against 1 €/bn expiring).
     <U+F0B7>   Substitution of secured retained bonds (pledged as collateral for Eurosystem’s auctions) with new
         covered bonds to be issued on the market.
Finally, ABACO credit claims are going to be restored for 2,6 €/bn, in order to be used as liquidity reserves
and to guarantee an adequate contingency liquidity buffer in case of new events of stress.
The funding position and the liquidity risk profile of the Group are expected to return to an adequacy area in
the next three years under the full execution of the liquidity funding strategy. The liquidity adequacy is
defined by the Key Risk Indicators projections, as described on the table below:
                                                                                                            17

Net Cash Position 1M over Total Assets is expected to grow up to 12% over the three years, due to liquidity
profile taking direct advantage from the new GGB, capital increase, disposal of NPLs and increase of
commercial deposits.
Also, LCR is expected to show an improvement to 182% in 2017, above the Risk Tolerance level of 130% over
the next three years. Increase of the forecasts on liquidity coverage ratio for 2017 are not only based on new
GGB to be issued, but also on the next capital increase that is followed by the NPLs disposal.
Through the RAS / budget projections the Group performs an implicit estimate of the minimum required
liquidity buffer over the next three years. In particular, starting from the expected net cash outflows, the
Group determines its minimum required volumes of liquid assets as shown below:
The minimum required level of liquid assets to reach the LCR Risk Appetite level range from 11,6 €/bn in 2017
and 2019 to 12,9 €/bn in 2018. Targeting the Risk Tolerance level, the minimum required liquidity buffer
range from 8,3 €/bn in 2017 to 9,4 €/bn in 2019. Referring to the LCR Risk Capacity level (set in line with the
regulatory full phase-in limit) the minimum required liquidity buffer must range from 6,4 €/bn in 2017 to 7,2
€/bn in 2019.
From a long-term perspective, according to the liquidity funding strategy NSFR is expected to increase to
111% in 2017, up to 113% over the next three years, mainly thanks to secured and unsecured issuances.
In order to understand the feasibility of the liquidity funding strategy with regard to the limit system set up
by the Risk Appetite Statement, the Group performs a medium/long stress test analysis on NSFR. The stress
test consists of several scenarios, each assuming a partial or complete failure of the main actions of the
liquidity funding strategy. In details, the risk factors used for the medium/long term stress test have been:
     <U+F0B7>    Unsecured issuances
     <U+F0B7>    Commercial funding
     <U+F0B7>    NPLs disposal
                                                                                                              18

Each scenario is composed by a likely combination of these risk factors, with the most severe of them
assuming a strong reduction of commercial funding (-50%) and a complete failure of NPLs disposal. The
results for the aforementioned scenario are described by the figure below:
As shown, even the most severe of the scenarios used in the medium/long term stress test brings to a NSFR
level of about 100%, in line with the Risk Capacity level established within the Risk Appetite Statement.
2.5. Concluding remarks and challenges
The 2016 has been characterized by severe and persistent liquidity crises. The final remarks and the main
challenges arisen from the analysis are shown below:
    <U+F0B7>    Overall, in a short term perspective, the Group presents a strongly stressed liquidity position, deeply
         deteriorated if compared to the end of last year. All liquidity risk indicators stand well far off the
         target level at 31/12/2016, in most cases breaching the limits. Even if at the beginning of the year
         the amount of liquidity reserves have proved to be adequate to withstand liquidity crises, liquidity
         stress experimented in January, in July and in the whole second half of 2016 have largely dried
         counterbalancing capacity. From January 2017 the Group has activated several actions in defense of
         short term liquidity position, in particular the program for issuing new Government Guaranteed
         Bonds.
    <U+F0B7>    Despite 2016’s liquidity crises, structural liquidity position does not show excessive weakness
         because the Group was able to accede to long term ECB auctions to compensate deposits run-off.
         Moreover, from January 2017 NSFR and other medium-long term metrics are expected to further
         improve thanks to the new long term funding operated through new GGB. Despite the ECB refunding
         support may make easier the process of re-balancing the funding position, in a longer term
         perspective the Group is well aware that funding profile should be balanced in the absence of
         extraordinary monetary measures: the funding strategy 2017-19 has the important role of coping
         with this issue, replacing ECB funding with unsecured funding.
    <U+F0B7>    The CBC is very concentrated in Italian Treasury bonds: this is a widespread situation over the
         banking system, but still remains an issue in a perspective view since the CBC is vulnerable to a single
         risk factor. However, in consideration of the Group’s typical funding channels, the availability of a
         large reserve in Italian Treasury bonds proved to be advantageous in terms of prompt funding
         capacity during the liquidity stress occurred during 2016.
                                                                                                               19

<U+F0B7> In 2016 liquidity crises have driven asset encumbrance to a very stressed level. In particular, the
  Group made large use of secured funding in order to compensate deposits run-off. In a medium term
  perspective asset encumbrance has to be mitigate so that liquidity reserves could be reconstituted in
  terms of encumberable assets. The funding strategy already addresses this issue defining a strong
  increase of unsecured funding that should enable the Group to reduce the asset encumbrance.
                                                                                                    20

3. Liquidity and funding risk management
  3.1. Overview of liquidity management and risk processes
  Processes and controls regarding risks to liquidity and funding cover the whole span of the Group’s business
  cycle. From a managerial perspective, the highest level of responsibility is encompassed and all key processes
  having an impact on liquidity and funding risk are taken into consideration within the Internal Liquidity
  Adequacy Assessment Process. The MPS organizational framework is based on the overarching responsibility
  of the Board of Directors regarding the main features of liquidity risk management. This involvement is
  defined in the “Directive on ILAAP” that requires the Board of Directors to determine the strategic approach
  to liquidity risk and approve each component of the liquidity risk management system (policies,
  responsibilities, risk framework); the management bodies (CEO, Committees), on the other hand, with the
  support of operating functions, are responsible for implementing the liquidity risk management system. The
  Directive on ILAAP is one of key element of the comprehensive revision of the liquidity documental
  framework carried out during 2016 which leaded to a new formalization of policies, processes and
  methodologies regarding liquidity risk management, ILAAP and their link with every other relevant aspect of
  Group business (strategic planning, budget, fund planning, risk allocation).
  A first consideration about risk processes regards the impact on liquidity coming from the strategic plan and
  the resulting budget/funding plan definition. Liquidity risk strategies have been defined for a twofold
  purpose: on the one hand, the commitment to pursue the Institution’s business model in an effective
  manner, on the other hand, the need to bring back the liquidity profile within the boundaries of a sustainable
  level of liquidity risk, as is determined at the RAS level. The Risk Appetite Statement, defined within the wider
  Risk Appetite Framework, and the Liquidity Risk Limits guarantee this consistency, establishing the key
  metrics to monitor and the consequent limit system to preserve the business model both in normal times
  and in stress conditions.
  It’s important to notice that the stress test framework is integrated into the key managerial processes: most
  of the limits established within the RAS have been calibrated through stress tests and the stress test
  framework has also a strong link with processes like the Liquidity Contingency Plan and the Group Liquidity
  Funding Strategy. The stress test calculation is also a reliable tool to assess the current stressed liquidity
  position of the Group, being based on a wide variety of stress scenarios. Intraday and short term stress tests
  are performed on a daily basis and give the Group the depiction of the stressed time to survival, one of the
  key metrics included in the Liquidity Risk Limits, while reverse stress test and medium/long term stress test
  are carried out at specific times during the year.
  Starting from the described approach to liquidity and funding risks, the entire span on internal operational
  processes moves down (organization, methodologies, procedures), forming the subject of the ILAAP
  reporting package.
  Among the key elements of the liquidity risk framework, it is worth to mention the following:
  <U+F0B7> the overarching structure of risk limits at Group level is defined within the Risk Appetite Statement and
      the subsequent Liquidity Risk Limits: key metrics have been formally defined with reference to intraday
      liquidity (potential daily liquidity), short term liquidity (stressed TTS, net cash position at 1 month over
      total asset, LCR) medium/long term liquidity (gap ratio curve, commercial gap ratio, asset encumbrance,
      NSFR) and concentration (concentration of funding and concentration of counterbalancing);
  <U+F0B7> measures and methodologies have been defined from a prudential perspective and stricter rules have
      been adopted to measure risks. In particular, the Group Risk Appetite Statement 2017-19 marks a step
      forward in designing the framework within which liquidity management must be carried out, introducing,
      besides Risk Capacity and Risk Tolerance, the new Risk Limit level. Another important addition to this
      strengthened framework are backtesting procedures, which are now regularly performed across a variety
      of internal models and procedures.
                                                                                                                 21

<U+F0B7> the overall system of internal controls can be deemed as sound and effective: limits control and specific
   risk analyses are performed with an adequate frequency and results are properly reported to the relevant
   functions and committees. Key control processes have also been reinforced with a deep review and a new
   formalization of specific processes related to ILAAP, risk mitigation, stress testing, escalation, remediation
   and reporting;
<U+F0B7> key processes impacting the Group liquidity position, as the funding strategy and the funding plan
   process, are now part of a wider, interconnected framework. The approach encompasses the RAF
   definition, strategic planning and budget constraints and the determination of consequent funding
   strategies. These elements, taken together, form a circular process that allows the group to monitor, on a
   periodic basis, the impact of funding plan execution or budget objectives fulfillment on liquidity risk.
3.2. Concluding remarks and challenges
As for the liquidity risk management and control assessment, a few concluding remarks and points of
improvement have been identified, as follows:
<U+F0B7> the liquidity risk framework and measurement system can be deemed as sound and effective. Liquidity
   related processes are part of a governance and organizational framework where risk taking and risk
   monitoring functions are clearly separated, responsibilities are identified and procedures are well known
   to the involved actors;
<U+F0B7> key decisions on funding strategies, limits definition, measurement methodologies, contingency actions
   and other governance arrangements are taken after discussion in the appropriate managerial committees
   and presented to the Board for approval;
<U+F0B7> the liquidity cost-benefit allocation mechanism is fully integrated within the Group key processes and
   formally defined by methodological and organizational documents which describe in details the
   functioning of liquidity transfer pricing. Nevertheless, a wider policy describing the interlinkages between
   the liquidity cost-benefit allocation mechanism and the risk management and overall management of the
   Group is still lacking.
<U+F0B7> while processes regarding stress testing have been already formally documented, a methodological
   manual for liquidity stress tests is going to be published by the end of May 2017. It should detail,
   compared to the current framework, at least the following aspects:
    <U+F0FC> formal definition of the approach to determine the reverse stress test;
    <U+F0FC> integration of specific stresses on budget/funding plan hypotheses, extending the scope of stress
         testing to the longer term horizon;
<U+F0B7> notwithstanding the Group monitors market conditions on a continuous basis, a policy document on
   maintaining presence in markets in order to ensure and periodically test market access and fund raising
   capacity is not available;
<U+F0B7> despite analyses on funding concentration have been set up and now constitute part of the periodic
   internal and external reporting flows, a policy document on funding concentration management has still
   to be defined.
                                                                                                               22

4. Areas of intervention
  In order to meet the main identified weaknesses and enhance the liquidity risk framework, the Group has
  planned a series of intervention to be enacted by the end of 2017. In particular
  <U+F0B7> a comprehensive cost-benefit allocation mechanism framework policy will be formalized and approved by
      31/12/2017;
  <U+F0B7> a methodological manual for liquidity stress test will be completed and approved by 31/05/2017;
  <U+F0B7> a policy document on maintaining presence in markets in order to ensure market access and fund raising
      capacity will be defined by 31/12/2017;
  <U+F0B7> a formalization of rules and processes governing funding concentration risk will take place by 31/12/2017.
                                                                                                            23
