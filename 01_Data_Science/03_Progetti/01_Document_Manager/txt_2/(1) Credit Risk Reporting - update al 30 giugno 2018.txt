Executive Summary – key points of 1H2018
 In the first semester of 2018 the performing portfolio and the non performing portfolio highlight two different dynamics.
 <U+F071> Regarding the performing portfolio we can observe a lot of positive signal, among which:
         <U+F071> the default flow, 645 mln in the first semester lower than the budget value of 825 mln and of 2,2 bln on a yearly basess (2017)
         <U+F071> the quality of the new lending in term of the probability of default equal to 1,13%, against a goal of 1,7% and the 1,24% in the 2017
         <U+F071> volumes of new lending equal to 6 bln in line with the budget of 6,3 bln.
 The only signals of alert are due to the different mix of new lending, more focused on corporate management expectations (+0,6 bln) and less on retail management (-0,9 bln), with
 consequent lower secured loans deriving from mortgage loans and worsening of the average lgd rate of the portfolio. We can observe furthermore a worsening of the average pd of
 performing customers both at the beginning and at the end of the first half of 2018, for about +9 bps, entirely due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of a limited number of
 corporate counterparties.
 <U+F071> Regarding the Non performing portfolio we can detect points of improvements :
         <U+F071> the improvement of the Cure Rate of Utop, Restructureted and Rischio Anomalo Loans. Neverthless the value observed is not in line either with the cure rate achieved by
             the peers or with the Budget
         <U+F071> the management of the Loans classified to Bad Loans by Centrale Rischi but not by MPS Group; the trend observed (a growing of 20 mln from the beginning of the current
             year) is opposite to the Utop’s one (reduction of 1,1 bln in the 1H of 2018, from 11,5bln to 10,4 bln)
         <U+F071> the management of the Utop’s portfolio ( increased of about 100 mln on loans with vintage>60 months)
         <U+F071> the improvement of the Recovery rate on the Bad loans portfolio, which is been affected by a delay of the Juliet’s start, and the conclusion of the Valentine’s securitization
 Positive trend of the Utop’s reduction, from 185 in the 1Q to 659 in the 1H with low disposal ‘s cost.
 Consequently the Cost of the Credit is under the budget by about 80 million ( mainly due to the lower flows of default) and the Rwa of Performing portfolio is over budget because of
 the less weight of the secured portfolio , the greater concentration of new exposures on Large Corporate and PMI and the slightly increase of the probability of the default on the
 stock of performing portfolio at the beginning of 2018.
                                                                                                                                                                                          2

The table above summarizes the limits breaches at 30/6/2018. It is confirmed the breaches already reported in May and it is noticed several new breaches mainly related to:
 <U+F0A7> Cure and Reduction (Bad Loans) continue to shows a trend lower than expected.
 <U+F0A7> Worsening towards UtoP/Bad Loans is affected by reclassification of several positions Past due and without forbearance measures from “IP RETE” to “Rischio Anomalo” and “Massivo”.
 <U+F0A7> Exposures Amount (Performing) is affected by repayment lower than budget in the month of June mainly for technical reasons (the last day of the month was non-working,
    consequently a lot of repayments was accounted in the first days of July).
 <U+F0A7> Average PD (Airb) mainly due to downgrading of some big counterparties.
