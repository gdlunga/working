1 – INTRODUCTION
This document aims describes the difference bet ween the measures of P1 and ICAAP capital
requirements, pursuant to SREP Guidelines. With this purpose, the document provides details
on methodologies and rationales which lead activities of risk integration (Pillar 2 perspective)
put in place for the Group, and on reconciliation with respect to Pillar 1 logic .
2 – RISK INTEGRATION AND RECONCILIATION
Pursuant to SREP Guidelines, the Group ensure ICAAP and ILAAP’s coverage of all risks to
which it is or might be exposed. In particular, the Group ensure that ICAAP and ILAAP are fully
and exhaustively implemented with respect to risk identification, risk relevance assessment,
integration and reconciliation with regulatory capital requirements.
Concerning risk integration and reconciliation, t he Group, consistently with the approach used
by the Supervision Authorities to define the Total SREP Capital Requirements, decided to use
the Pillar 1 Plus approach in order to provide risk integration and, hence, to end up with the
estimation of Total Internal Capital Requirements.
The methodology mainly takes into account the Pillar 1 risks and         the significant measurable
Pillar 2 risks. In addition, the Group evaluates the completeness        and adequacy of Pillar 1
measures. In particular, if the Pillar 1 measure is considered          insufficient or missing to
accurately estimate the risk of the Group, the Pillar 1 measure is      replaced by internal model
estimation within the ICAAP scope.
The main differences between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital estimat es concern Market Risk and
additional Pillar 2 risks. Regarding Market Risk, the Group believes that the Pillar 1
approach is not a complete methodology to estimate the risk under Pillar 2 perspective;
therefore, an internal model for quantifying the Internal Capital is used. The internal model
covers both Trading Book and AFS portfolio of Banking Book; the approach used for the
estimation of the Internal Capital is based on VaR methodology. In particular, the VaR model
involves:
     <U+F0B7>  all risk factors except the interest rate (included in the IRRBB) for the AFS portfolio ;
        hence, the measure includes the credit spread risk for sovereign positions (not
        considered in Pillar 1);
     <U+F0B7>  all risk factors for the Trading Book.
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, additional Pillar 2 risks identified within the ICAAP
scope are:
     <U+F0B7>  Interest Rate Risk on Banking Book;
     <U+F0B7>  Concentration Risk;
     <U+F0B7>  Business and Strategic Risk.
Coherently with the Pillar 1 Plus approach, and in order to ensure the accuracy of regulatory
capital adequacy assessment, a one-year holding period is used for all risk categories, while

                         Disclosed on:        19/04/2017                           Pg. 3 di 4
the considered confidence              level is      99,9%,     except for Market Risk (see chapter 3 –
Methodological Annexes).
In order to estimate the Total Internal Capital Requirements, the Internal Capital
Requirements of each risk are added up (Building Block approach) without considering
inter-risk diversification.
Basing on Pillar 1 Plus and Building Block approaches, the Group provides the risk aggregation,
under Pillar 2 perspective, by reconciling risk items between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 as shown in
the figure below.
