    <U+F071> Stage 3 exposure at 21,3 €/bn (excluding bad loans in Valentine Perimeter), substantially flat vs December 2017, with a reduction of IP Rete and Rischio Anomalo. The
      coverage, at 57,2% shows a grow of approx. 84 bps, mainly due to the increase of coverage of Rischio Anomalo and Ristrutturati
    <U+F071> Net Loan Loss Provision for the IQ 2018 at 126,8 €/mln vs. 162 €/mln of the Budget. The cost for the Quarter is affected by a reversal of provision of about 39 €/mln, due
      to a reduction of Bad Loans in the Valentine perimeter. Excluding this component the cost of credit would be approx. 166 €/mln higher than Budget despite a low default
      flow
    <U+F071> Total strengthening flow in line with the budget (+25 €/mln): the over budget of Corporate Division (+700 €/mln) and Widiba (+9 €/mln) is substantially off-set by the
      Retail (-648 €/mln) and Wealth (-36 €/mln). Total overhauling flows lower than the budget (-65,5%) due to the Corporate Division (+48 €/mln) and Retail Division (+39
      €/mln)

      Anomalo allocated on DCNP is lower than the target (59 €/mln, -159 €/mln vs. budget). Lower than expected also Recovery on bad loans positions (-46%) and Flows
      from Restructured and Rischio Anomalo to Bad Loans (243 €/mln, -256 €/mln vs. Budget)
    <U+F071> As of 31/3/2018 it is reported 15 breaches of the limits. The breaches are substantially related to the Cure Rate on Utop Loans and the Reduction of Utop/Bad Loans for
      CLO Division; to the Average PD, Exposure Amount on Performing Portfolio and the Worsening flows from Past due to Utop/Bad Loans for COO Division
