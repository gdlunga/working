SUBJECT: Credit Risk – Prior notification of changes included in the calibration of the
PD models and in the estimation of the LGD models carried out in 2018
Dear Sirs and Madams,
pursuant to Article 143, paragraph 4, of Regulation (EU) No.575/2013 and to EU Regulation
529/2014, paragraph 5, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, as Parent Company (GMPS
hereafter), being already authorized to use the advanced IRB models since June 2008, hereby
notifies its intention to make changes considered non-material to the internal rating system.
In accordance with Article 179 of Regulation (EU) No.575/2013 which envisages that
institutions review its own estimates when new relevant information emerge and in any case
at least annually, GMPS updated the internal rating system with the calibration of the PD
models and the estimation of the LGD models incorporating the evidence of the last years in
the time series.
The PD calibration and LGD estimation activities were performed according with internal
developing framework and were subject to revision by the Validation function.
In order to improve the accuracy of the internal rating system and to resolve some of the
findings detected during the IMI40 and TRIMI investigations, the following changes have been
introduced:
    -   extension of the time series length for the calibration of the PD models and for the
        estimation of the LGD model components: LGS, Danger Rate, LGD Performing (finding
        No.9 TRIMI);
    -   introduction of a MOC for the assignment of the PD for counterparties classified as
        forborne (finding No.8 IMI40).
These changes were assessed as non-material on the basis of the regulatory principles
included in the Delegated Regulation (EU) No.529/2014 that have been transposed in the
internal model change policy ( D02221 “Identificazione e gestione del model change - rischio di
credito”).
Below are the details of the assessment and attached the application forms in accordance with
the “Guidelines on submitting requests relating to internal models to the European Central
Bank” reported in the ECB communication of 7 June 2018.

      1. Model change 2018_1: time series lenght
Current situation
PD models and Danger Rate models, currently implemented, were estimated on a 7-year time
series for Corporate and on a 5-year time series for Retail on the basis both of a through cycle
oriented approach, adopted by the GMPS from the first IRB implementation, and both in the
absence of a specific framework for the analysis of the "likely range of variability" of default
rates.
The LGS was estimated on the following historical data:
      - for closed bad loans the exposures classified as bad loans from 01/01/1999 to
          31/12/2014 (16 years) and with the recovery process closed from 01/01/2005 (10
          years closed files)
      - for incomplete work-out the exposures still open as of 31/12/2014 and classified as
          bad loans from 01/01/1999 or before 01/01/2000 or regardless of the bad loan
          entrance date but with coverage ratio >= 99%.
Change Adopted
Since May 2017, GMPS adopted an internal framework for the evaluation of time series for
models development, in line with the requirements provided for in Article 49 of the Final
Draft Regulatory Technical Standards on the specification of the assessment methodology
(EBA/RTS/2016/03). This framework had been included in the application package for the
material model change request submitted to the ECB on 10 November 20171 and in the
documentation supporting the TRIMI 2017 (ITMPS 2939).
In the TRIMI 2017, it was detected that current models were developed without taking into
account the new internal framework and the analysis required by Article 49 of the assessment
RTS (finding No.9 TRIMI2).
The internal framework includes analysis on the likely range of variability of default rates and
analysis on specific macroeconomic indicators in order to identify a time series with an
adequate mix of expansive and recessive periods. The analysis carried out are reported in the
internal model documents.
Based on the results of the analysis , a 10-year time series, from January 2008 to January
2018, has been selected and used in the calibration of the PD models and in the estimation of
the Danger Rate, both for Corporate and Retail segments3. The selected time series contains
an equilibrate mix of positive and negative periods (4.5 recessive years and 5.5 expansive
years) and guarantees a likely range of variability of default rates.
As regards the estimate of the LGS, the reference period remained fixed at 16 years with a
shift of time series of current LGS model aimed to include the evidence of the most recent

  the IRB system, which takes into account the resolution actions for regulatory findings and the implementation of the new
  regulatory DoD.,
2 TRIMI 2017 Finding No.9: “the lack of analysis in terms of representativeness of the period in calculating the long average default rate can
  hinder the model predictive ability. The current framework depicts a prudential choice of the historical period; anyway, the Istitution has
  introduced the analysis of the “the likely range of variability” of default rates in the model change application sent too Supervisory authority in
  2017”.

years. Respect to the previous model, for closed bad loans no time limits have been set on the
closing date of the files, in order to include a more complete information data set: the
exposures classified as bad loans from 01/01/2002 to 31/12/2017 (16 years) and process of
recovery closed from 01/01/2002 (16 years vs 10 years of the current model).
Regarding the incomplete work-out, the approach is unchanged: files open for more than 15
years or with coverage of at least 99%.
The model change has been assessed as "non-material", according with art. 5 c) of Annex 1,
Part 1, Section 2 ("Changes requiring prior notification to competent authorities") of
Delegated Regulation (EU) No.529/2014: "change in the length and composition of time series
used for parameter estimation". The verification of the quantitative criteria envisaged in the
internal policy (D02221) confirmed the non-material classification of the intervention, as the
model change led to an increase of capital requirements: the model change involved 95% of
the IRB system in terms of RWA and led to an increase of 1950 Eur/millions in terms of RWA.

       2. Model change 2018_2: MOC forborne
Current situation
Since 2009, forbearance transactions (“moratoria”) granted to counterparties in economic
difficulty have started to represent a significant phenomenon. Therefore GMPS introduced
specific measures to correctly capture the riskiness of these counterparties.
This treatment provides for extension of the period to observe the occurrence of the default in
order to verify the performance after the conclusion of moratoria: the end of observation
period is then translated from 12 months after the reference date to 12 months after the
conclusion of moratoria.
The treatment also provides for the elimination from RDS of performing counterparties with
ongoing moratoria for which the observation period is considered not sufficient for the
classification in bonis/default (phenomenon is present in the last reference dates of
development population).
Change Adopted
GMPS decided to modify the approach for the treatment of the moratoria in order to achieve
the following aims:
       - to simplify the procedure for defining the calibration population without modifying or
              eliminating the original RDS information that may produce problems of
              representativeness of the development population (finding No.8 IMI40, obligation
              No.5)4;
4 IMI40 2015, Obligation No.5
Finding No.8: The Supervised Entities use an approach aimed at classifying the forborne exposures through an ex-post rule in the calibration
phase. This approach determines the exclusion of a significant share of counterparties for whom the observation period is not over yet. In order
to offset this data exclusion, the Supervised Entities defined an add-on on the PDs. Although the internal validation function expressed a positive

       -      to take into account the change in the internal regulatory framework of the GMPS: in
              the first half of 2015 the internal regulatory document "1030D01991 GMPS Policy on
              classification and credit assessment" was published, which provides for greater
              severity in the detection of the default and in the classification of exposures forborne.
              It follows therefore that the follow-up of the position in moratorium takes place
              through the classification of the same in the forborne category;
       -      to take into account the greater riskiness of the current and future positions in
              forborne through the introduction of an explicit MOC, as required by the regulation.
The new approach is based on the new forborne credit classification process, implemented in
November 2015, which allows a more accurate classification of counterparties with
forbearance, and on the assignment of a rating aligned with the higher risk observed on
forborne portfolio. Hereafter the steps carried out with the new methodology:
       -      detection of default observed on forborne portfolio since 2015;
       -      introduction of a MOC to be applied to counterparties classified as forborne through a
              definition of PD floor determined on the basis of the default rates observed on
              forborne portfolio;
       -      the PD pre MOC for forborne counterparties is compared with the PD floor; the PD post
              MOC has to be equal to the maximum between PD pre MOC and PD floor.
The new approach significantly improves the accuracy of the PD assigned to the forborne
counterparties and resolves the criticality of the representativeness of the calibration
population as detected in the IMI40 obligation No.5.
The model change was assessed as "non-material", according with art. 2 h) of Annex 1, Part 1,
Section 2 ("Changes requiring prior notification to competent authorities") of Delegated
Regulation (EU) No.529/2014: " changes in the methodology for estimating PDs". The MOC
forborne led to RWA increase of 920 Eur/millions in terms of RWA. Consequently, the
verification of the quantitative criteria confirmed the non-material classification of the
intervention, as the model change led to a further increase in capital requirements.

opinion on this calibration process, a challenger model was not put in place by the internal control function to confirm the accuracy of the add-
on. According to the understanding of ECB, the Supervised Entities do not fulfil the legal requirements set out for this finding since the data used
to calibrate the model is not fully representative of the actual exposures of the institution. This understanding is reflected in Article 40 (2) of
EBA/RTS/2016/03

Finally, it is noted that:
      - as regard LGS model, an intervention on the internal methodology for the indirect cost
             allocation was carried out in order to assign indirect costs to all files of RDS. The
             current methodology envisages an allocation of indirect costs based on residual debt of
             the customers; the new approach has introduced a replacement value in case of zero
             residual debt which is equal to the product between EAS exposure of the file and
             average indirect cost percentage, calculated on the files with residual different from
             zero.
             The new methodology resolves the IMI 40 finding No. 12, Obligation No.95.
      - as regard LGD data quality documentation, a detail note of the process followed to
             control the accuracy and completeness of LGD Reference Data Set was included in the
             LGD methodological documentation, resolving the TRIMI finding No. 176.
After two months from the date of this notification, and unless you communicate otherwise,
GMPS will proceed with the implementation of the solution described.

Finding No.12: The indirect cost allocation mechanism assigns zero costs to approximately 15% of files in the Reference Data Set (RDS) for the
LGD of the Supervised Entities. Such effect is due to the fact that the cost allocation is based on the residual debt of customers.
Obligation No.9: The Supervised Entities shall allocate indirect costs to all files included in the RDS for the LGD estimation.
