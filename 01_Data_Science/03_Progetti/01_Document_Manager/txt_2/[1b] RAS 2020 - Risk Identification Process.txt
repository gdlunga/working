MPS Group Risk Identification Process – General overview
The Group takes the opportunity to better represent the following topics concerning its risk identification process, also based on feedbacks
emerged within recent communications with Supervision Authorities:
      • the methodology underlying such process, by focusing on criteria which drive the classification of risks in each category, making the
          BoD acquainted;
      • the implications, in terms of monitoring and controls, of classifying each risk in a certain category.
Accordingly, the following slides reports the main elements of the methodology employed, which, de facto, is quite close to what was already
used in practice albeit less formally.
The methodology considers both quantitative elements and scores deriving from qualitative assessments, ending up with a preliminary interim
classification of risks, then made definitive by applying an “expert layer”.
Quali-quantitative criteria are going to be synthetically illustrated, highlighting the way through which each criteria influence the preliminary
assessment of risks. Most relevant criteria, the rationale of their relevance and final classification are described within the specific assessment
of each risk.
In addition, the present document aims also to suggest to BoD a correlation between each category of classification of risks and the treatment
in terms of monitoring/controls.
Such approach also strive to respond to ECB Guidelines on ICAAP, whose point n. 63 declares: “The management body is responsible for
deciding which risk types are to be considered material, and which material risks are to be covered by capital. This includes a justification of
why a certain risk the institution is exposed to is not considered material”.
                                                                                                                                                    6

MPS Group Risk Identification Process – Methodological approach
Process and definition of criteria
Similarly to previous years, the risk identification process is based on information such as for
• risks-to-capital: RWA weights (meant as percentage of RWA for single risk with respect to the total RWA – Pillar 2 scope), deductions from
    Own Funds, variability of each risk RWA, supervisory regulations and communications , Group strategies and expected scenarios.
• risks-to-liquidity: RSF on total assets (meant as Required Stable Funding for funding risk, denominator of NSFR), variability of indicators of
    the other liquidity risks (LCR, NSFR, daily potential liquidity, concentration risk indicator), supervisory regulations and communications,
    Group strategies and expected scenarios.
Within the scope of 2020 Risk Identification, it is proposed to explicit such criteria and their impacts on the classification, by using a score
system similar to SREP Decision mechanism, so attaining a first quantitative evaluation, enriched and completed by a final «expert layer» step
in order to obtain the final risk classification.
Four relevance levels
The number of relevance classes has been augmented to 4 (with respect to the three used until the last year’s risk identification process). It is
believed that introducing a fourth level of relevance may be useful to ensure a higher flexibility and diversification capability, for example to
distinguish between lowly relevant risks and non-material risks. Moreover, a 4-level classification results to be more consistent with the majority
of the other classifications, that are, for example, Internal Validation judgements or SREP Decision mechanism.
Gross approach
Starting from this year a “gross approach” view will be introduced, accordingly to ECB Guide on ICAAP (point n. 61), “The risk identification
process is expected to follow a “gross approach”, i.e. without taking into account specific techniques designed to mitigate the underlying risks.
The institution is then expected to assess the effectiveness of these mitigating actions”.
From classification to control
Belonging to a higher relevance class will then mean belonging to a higher level of control/monitoring.
                                                                                                                                                    7

MPS Group Identification Process – Risks-to-Capital – 1/2: Quantitative and qualitative criteria
  CRITERIA
                 It is the main criterion which determines the starting point of the process. It considers RWAs and deductions from Own
                 Funds (where applicable, deductions are expressed in terms of RWA by multiplying them for 12,5). Such criterion is
RWA weights +    mapped along 4 classes (1=High Risk, 4=Non material Risk), according to the cumulated distribution of decreasing
 Deductions      weights. Since the core risk (Credit Risk) accounts for more than 45% of measured RWA, following thresholds have been
                 chosen: 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%.
  Mitigating     If the risk has a material/medium level of mitigation, its relevance, initially determined by the RWAs (+deductions) weight, is
   actions       augmented by one/half class.
                 Historical volatility of RWA over the last two years (monthly values) is mapped along the following four classes: [0%-10%]
  Historical
                 minimal volatility, ]10%-25%] low volatility, ]25%-50%] medium volatility, >50% high volatility. Accordingly, relevance level
   volatility
                 increases or decreases, with following scoring: High volatility=+1, Medium=+0,5, Low=no change, Minimal=-0,5).
                 External component criterion is the average score between two elements: the first element is the focus of the regulator on
   External      specific risk, the second element is how the scenario impacts on specific risk. Regulatory element evaluation includes
 components      existing or envisaged normatives and regulations, the results of the OSI, SREP decision, and all other interactions with
                 regulators. The scenario element evaluates how macroeconomic scenarios, operational environment and idiosyncratic
                 elements impact on specific risk. Relevance of external component could be high, medium, low or minimal.
   Internal      The internal components criterion regards potential impacts and focus on single risk which may arise from risk framework
 components      evolutions, procedural modifications and strategic/operational plans. Relevance of internal components could be high,
                 medium, low or minimal.

MPS Group Identification Process – Risks-to-Liquidity – 1/2: Quantitative and qualitative criteria
  CRITERIA       It is the main criterion which determines the starting point of the process. It considers RSF (Required Stable Funding ) on
                 total asset as an central key metric to evaluate current and forward-looking liquidity position. Such criterion is mapped
 RSF on total    along 3 classes (1=High Risk, 3=Low Risk) excluding the forth class because liquidity risk can not be considered as non-
    assets       material risk, according to following thresholds: 40%, 50%, 60%. In other words, if RSF on total assets was steadily below
                 40% all liquidity risks are considered Low Risk while if RSF on total assets has been stably over 60% then all liquidity risks
                 are evaluated as High Risk.
  Mitigating     If the risk assessed has a material/medium level of mitigation, its relevance, initially determined by the RSF, is augmented
   actions       by one/half class.
                 For each liquidity risks, historical volatility of Key Risk Metrics (NSFR, LCR, daily potential liquidity and concentration risk
  Historical     indicators) over the last two years (monthly values) is mapped along the 4 classes, and, accordingly, the level of relevance
   volatility    is incremented/decremented (High volatility=+1 class, Medium=+0,5, Low=no change, Very Low=-0,5)
                 External component criterion is composed by two elements: the first element is the focus of the regulator on specific risk,
   External      the second element is how the scenario impacts on specific risk. Regulatory element evaluation includes existing or
 components      envisaged normatives and regulations, the results of the OSI, SREP decision, and all other interactions. The scenario
                 element evaluates how macroeconomic scenarios, operational environment and idiosyncratic elements impact on specific
                 risk. Relevance of external components could be high, medium, low or not existent.
   Internal      The internal components criterion regards potential impacts and focus on single risk which may arise from risk framework
 components      evolutions, procedural modifications and strategic/operational plans.

Business &      The level of expected results of Restructuring Plan 2018-2021, in terms of economics evolution (NII & Commission             HIGH
Strategic Risk  growth and sensible reduction of administrative costs), imply a high execution risk – current and perspective - for
                the Group. As a matter of fact, business results represent a central point of attention by supervision authorities, at
                the systemic level and specifically for MPS (as, for example, manifested in the last SREP draft decision).
                Therefore, overall business & strategic risk relevance is assessed as “high”.
Credit Risk     Credit activity represents the core business of the Group, and it is the biggest source of risk. Credit risk RWA             HIGH
                represents almost 50% of Group’s total RWA.
                In risk identification process, the Group follows the “gross approach”, which means risk relevance is evaluated
                taking into account risk mitigation tecniques also.
                Credit quality improvement activities continued and will continue to be addressed (i.e. bad loans disposal
                programme as contained into MPS Restructuring Plan 2018-2021). Credit risk relevance remains unchanged
                (high), also in light of envisaged regulatory normative such as the new definition of default and the addendum on
                non-performing loans provisioning.
                                                                                                                                             HIGH
Legal Risk      Since legal risk is a very relevant component of operational risk, the Group decided to assess it separately.
                The exposure of MPS to legal risk has grown in recent years, mainly due to extraordinary events connected to the
                legal proceedings concerning the capital increases that took place from 2008 to 2015. In addition the precautionary
                recapitalisation carried out with State support in the 2017 is likely to result in more litigations know as “Burden
                Sharing” event.
                Legal risk is subjected to particular attention by regulators and it was recently under supervisory review.
                                                                                                                                                       15

Market Risk      Notwithstanding the reduction of sovereign exposures, market risk remains one of the main risks which the Group             HIGH
                 is exposed to, mainly due to external elements (the potential volatily of relevant underlying market variables) and
                 internal elements (the unexpected losses estimation of «Amortised Cost» portfolio, introduced within the 2019
                 ICAAP scope).
                 In addition, expectation for the envisaged regulatory innovation on capital requirements calculation concerning
                 Trading portfolio (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book) are to be considered.
Operational Risk The keys element of the ongoing Restructuring Plan are costs reduction, which will be mainly achieved by laying off         HIGH
                 5.500 employees, who will join the Fondo di Solidarietà. This operation is also likely to result in more litigations.
                 Another key pillar of the Restructuring Plan is a renewed operating model, aimed at improving efficiency, including
                 an extensive automation/digitalisation of business processes which will involve the whole Group.
                 The plan will also require a complete re-design of the bank's network by reducing the number of coordination
                 centres and branches. This restructuring process exposes the Group to potential operational risks.
                 The Operational Risk includes the Legal Risk, IT Risk and Cybersecurity Risk. Therefore, it reflects the assessment
                 of those components.
                 In the end, the high relevance remains unchanged with respect to previous year.
                                                                                                                                                       16

Counterparty    At the date of 30/06/2019, the Group holds around 29,6 €/bm of ante-CRM exposure-at-default and 4,5 €/bn of                 MEDIUM
Risk            post-CRM regulatory EAD. MPS Group assesses counterparty risk relevance as “medium”, considering:
                • the high impact of risk mitigation techniques, such as ISDA and CSA, impacting regulatory EAD;
                • the significant historical volatility of RWAs;
                • the future introduction of new standardised model to estimate unexpected losses (i.e. SA-CCR).
Cyber Security  Cyber security risk is an important component of operational risk, so it is assesses separately. Cyber security risk is     MEDIUM
Risk            introduced starting from 2020 risk identification process.
                Whilst no RWA estimation is provided, the Group deems cyber security risk as material, with a «medium»
                relevance, due to the attention given both by supervision authorities and by Group’s business and control functions.
Interest Rate   As for the last year, Group interest rate structure remains “asset sensitive”. In particular, in case of +/- 100 bps in     MEDIUM
Risk in Banking interest rates level, at date of 30 June 2019, the Group would face economic value variations in a range of [+219;-
Book            121] €/mln.
                Besides such sensitivity structure, risk relevance is assessed as “medium” because of the following further
                considerations:
                • historically, IRRBB RWAs show a high level of volatility;
                • IRRBB was recently under Supervisory review; furthermore, the internal framework is currently under review and
                    material changes may arise.

IT Risk            IT risk is an important component of operational risk, therefore it is assessed individually. Such risk category is       MEDIUM
                   introduced starting from 2020 risk identification process.
                   Although the Group does not provide an estimation of unexpected losses in terms of RWA, the relevance of IT risk
                   is perceived as “medium” in light of:
                   • the possibility of COG disposal, for which the strategy has not been defined yet;
                   • the focus on such risk treatment by both supervision authorities and the Group internal functions.
Participation Risk Participation risk mainly stems from the relevant partnership with AXA Group.                                             MEDIUM
                   Despite a low level of unexpected losses in terms of RWA, participation risk relevance is assessed as “medium” in
                   light of the following items:
                   • deductions from own funds have been taken into account;
                   • a significant historical volatility of RWA.
Reputational       During the last years, the Group has been affected by credibility issues, that has affected its capital and liquidity     MEDIUM

                   According to that, the Group has recently launched its Reputational Risk Framework as a tool to improve
                   monitoring and managing Reputational Risk.
                   Considering the improved framework and the fact that MPS’s reputation improved during 2018 (as shown by
                   surveys on external and internal sentiment on Group’s reputation), then risk relevance is assessed as “medium”,

Compliance     Taking into account both regulatory focus and internal procedures aiming to mitigate compliace risk, the Group              LOW
Risk           assesses the relevance of such risk as «low».
Concentration  Similarly to previous year assessment, the Group evaluates this risk relevance as «low» because of the moderate             LOW
Risk           level of estimated RWA. Anyway, the Group is aware of its cospicuous concentration of business toward credit
               activities.
CVA Risk       CVA risk is represented separately from counterparty risk, starting from 2020 risk identification process.                  LOW
               Although the presence of significant level of historical volatility, the forthcoming regulatory model changes and the
               high impact that risk mitigation techniques have on regulatory EAD, the Group assesses the risk relevance as
               «low» given a substantially meagre amount of estimated RWA.
DTA Risk       Such risk category is introduced starting from 2020 risk identification process.                                            LOW
               Risk assessment takes into account both RWA and deductions from own funds deriving from DTA. In assessing the
               final DTA Risk relevance as «low», it is considered that the deferred taxes is expected not to change significally,
               and the variability of RWA also depends on the dynamics of the CET1 Capital.

                 unexpected losses estimation shows a steady decreasing trend. According to that, the Group downgrades the risk

Lapse Risk       Lapse risk is a new risk for MPS Group, stemming from new commercial agreement with AXA.                                    LOW
                 Notwithstanding a very low level of capital absorption which would imply a non-materiality of this risk, the Group
                 assesses its relevance as “low” in light of future possible expansion of the underlying business.
Model Risk       The Group ha devoted significant attention to this risk. In fact, starting from this year, the new framework adopted        LOW
                 by the Group provides a RWA estimation for model risk, based on Internal Validation findings. As a result of the
                 assessment, risk relevance is considered «low», in decrease with respect to previous risk identification, in light of
                 improved risk monitoring procedures.
Real Estate Risk Although RWA for real estate risk are relevant, the Group assesses the risk relevance as «low» given:                       LOW

                   partially addressed during last years, risk relevance is still assessed as “high” due to a deep regulatory focus on
                   internal models used to determine cash outflows (LiST 2019).

                   the current planned Funding Strategy, therefore risk relevance is assessed as “high”.

(1) Credit risk refers only to lending exposures deriving from commercial activities (such as credit facilities, mortgages, etc.) and other financial transactions (such as collateral agreement, etc).
(2) Differently from last year risk identification process, CVA risk is assessed separately from counterparty risk.
(3) For Market Risk purpose, two measures are provided (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements). Within Pillar 1 scope, Banking Book positions are included into calculation of FX and Commodity
    risk measures. Market exposures accounted into FVOCI and AC category are included into Pillar 2 risk measures.
(4) Differently from last year risk identification process, Legal Risk, IT Risk and Cyber Security Risk, although included within operational risk, receive individual assessments.
(5) Relatively to point i) of definition in previous slides, model risk management scope in MPS Group covers only A-IRB, AMA and IRRBB models.
