1      Executive summary
              Our analysis confirmed stronger credit risk controls, achieved through the updating of regulations, rules, processes and specific monitoring exercises aimed at enhancing the effectiveness
  OVERVIEW    of operations. Overall, just two of the actions underway (Findings 2 and 9) have been rated “Yellow”, the Audit activities related to Findings 3 will be carried out in the 4Q 2018 while those
              related to the Finding 1 have been planned in 2019. Relatively to Finding 4 the High Risk implementation activities were completed including the quarterly information flows for the Board of
   ARGO 3
              Directors. Remedial Actions currently “Open” relate to Findings 1 and 3 (concerning just the MPS Group subsidiaries) and 6 (relating to the IT component). For the Finding 4 the activities
              relating to the Group's subsidiaries remain to be finalized.
             The method used to calculate the haircuts applied to the value of real estate collateral has been integrated with an update to the time series, the application of the new threshold set for
             individual assessments, the inclusion of recovery costs in order to net the realisable value of real estate assets, update of the cure rate and inclusion of the “forward-looking” elements
             required by the new IFRS 9. The new haircuts were approved by the BoD on 12/07/2018 and included in Annex 2 of the new D.1991. Regarding the timely update of Business Plans,
    NPL      policies have been updated and integrated to take account of the recently revised organisational model of the CLO Division. As at 05/07/2018, the Business Plan updating process had
             been successfully completed for 90.2% of the portfolio under Direct Management and for 92.6% of the portfolio assigned to Juliet. As for the portfolio with expired Business Plans, the
             procedure/methodology used by the relevant functions and control units were not adequately set out in a specific document. It was therefore agreed that the Group’s Loan Classification
             and Provisioning Policy required updating. Areas of improvement were also identified in the quality of data entered in the IT systems.
             The Risk Management Function produced summary data to demonstrate the equality between the balance sheet exposure and the EAD amount, net of the off-balance sheet exposure, used
             in the calculation of Expected Credit Loss according to the new IFRS9. The analysis of the procedure used to construct data for the EAD and the balance sheet value (included in the
 CALCULATION material sent to support the resolution of Finding #2 did not point to any factors of concern. The Findings from the sample analysed confirm the inclusion of interests calculated during the
   OF EAD    moratoria period and accrued interest in the calculation of EAD at single borrower level. The process was replicated and it is confirmed a marginal misalignment of € 47 million between the
             balance sheet exposure and total EAD. This difference was also confirmed in the processing of 30 June 2018. The corrective actions were directed to the competent function (COG) for the
             appropriate solutions.
              A detailed description for each parameter has been included in Annex 1 of D1991 along with a reference to the specific data sources. The list of parameters has been updated as reported
              in the bank’s letter to the ECB dated 15/03/2018. In compliance with the request of the Supervisor, the D1991 establishes that the Position Manager must necessarily reclassify the position
              with an activated binding parameter. In the event of no classification, a specific process will be initiated leading to a forced classification. Only two situations are exempt from this and are
   CREDIT     expressly detailed in the Policy. At the level of non-binding parameters, the average reclassification rate per parameter stands at 12% for high-priority and 2% for low-priority, in line with
   DEFAULT    what emerges from the document and the back-testing performed by the independent auditors. The 1st and 2nd level controls system, particularly with forborne positions, has been
              strengthened with the creation of a specialist High Risk Credit Unit, whose areas of competence include that of assessing the financial difficulties of borrowers when granting forbearance
  DETECTION   measures and the consequent correct classification; the 1st level control function (the Credit Process and Quality Service Unit), performs a set of controls aimed at monitoring the quality of
              the credit process in compliance with D2284 and, in particular, the implementation of monitoring activities as per the Bank’s reply to the ECB on 15/03/2018; the monitoring activities
              conducted by the 2nd level control function (SCEC) are aimed at ensuring proper detection during the credit decision process as well as the consistency of classification assessments
              relating to the processing of parameters.
             Compared to the last report on Argo 2, the RA #31 is the only recommendation still to complete. For the RA #12 the centralization campaign of the mortgages of the perimeter (January 2002
             – July 2016) has been finalized and all the retrieved documentation has been sent to the outsourcer for the digitalization, the data quality and archiving. For the RA #12 the group regulation
   ARGO 2    on credit processes has been transposed to da MPS CS and MPS L&F, the credit monitoring process and the analysis of classification parameters are effective. The extension of the IT
             applications for accounting management of litigation (AMCZ) of the Parent Company to MPSCS has not been started pending the definition of strategic options on the company. The IT
             impact on the procedures of the subsidiaries MPS CS and MPS L & F falls in the program of releases of RA 31 instead.

    Finding # 5: Counting of days past due for “moratoria” and “Extra Fido” exposures (1/2)
               The Bank is requested to put in place and/or complete all actions needed to definitively solve the issue regarding the counting of days past due on all the exposures.
Recommendation With reference to “moratoria” exposures, the Bank is requested to avoid any reset of the history of past due amounts, in order to allow a proper classification of the exposures.
               Moreover, as far as the “extra fido” exposures are concerned, the Bank shall ensure that the counting of the days past-due is compliant with Circular 272 and other applicable
               regulations.
               Implement all actions necessary to correct the counting of past due days:
               • For “extra fido” exposures, the counting of days will have to start from the date the additional loan was granted;
  Deliverables • For “moratoria” exposures, the freezing of the days past due at the time the moratorium is granted is no longer necessary since it is managed through Forborne rules.
               • Use of the correct method for calculating the days past due in the Bank’s procedures;
               • Identification of “moratoria” exposures as Forborne exposures.

      exposures).
          CLOSED : The freezing of days past due, originally provided in the Bank of Italy’s letter of 31/05//2012, has been replaced with the Bank of Italy’s 7th update of 20/01/2015, Circular 272. The update incorporates the new
          classification rules for exposures, as provided for by the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) and has introduced the category of forborne exposures to which specific rules apply for the classification of exposures as
          performing/non performing. The Bank has correctly applied the rules in force for the classification of forborne exposures, which do not require the freezing of days past due
      n. 2 - Extra-fido: failure to calculate the days past due from the date the extra-fido is granted, when past due amounts are produced in the additional loan (Bank of Italy Circ. 272– Section. B – Par. 2 Credit Quality – nota 2 -
      pg. B 8)- .
          CLOSED : in February 2017 the rule for calculating past dues was upgraded, establishing that the days past due on an extra-fido exposure are to be counted starting from the date the extra-fido is granted and not from the
          date the customer begins to produce the past due amount, as required by Circular 272. This rules also applies in the case of a past due being produced in the extra-fido with a customer who is past due in the previous loan.
      n. 3 – Calculation of Minimum Balance Available: incorrect calculation of the past due amount for the calculation of items not yet “certain/available” under “Cash Exposures” (bank checks presented and not paid at the same
      time).

               In order to comply with the definition of Forbearance provided by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227, the Bank is requested to:
               • solve the weaknesses found during the investigation and, in particular, to automatically classify to non-performing the forborne exposures under probation period that meet the
                  criteria of reclassification. To this extent, the Bank is requested to implement the necessary IT system in order to comply with this recommendation. Pending the completion of
                  the IT developments, the Bank shall establish a dedicated monitoring of forborne exposures under probation,
               • reinforce first and second level controls, at least, on clients subject to credit decisions while showing signs of potential financial difficulties (e.g. inclusion in watch-list or flagged
Recommendation    as high risk). In addition, considering that the financial difficulty of a debtor cannot be automatically detected in every case, the Bank is required to establish specific internal
                  control procedures in order to avoid or at least limit the potential misclassification of forborne exposures by the commercial network.

7   Finding # 7: Adequacy of classification parameters for default detection (1/3)
               The shortcomings related to processes and policies of Finding #1 are addressed in this recommendation.
               The shortcomings of Finding #7 related to IT are addressed in the recommendation related to Finding #1.
               The Bank is requested to review, together with its external auditors, the list of parameters included in “Allegato 1” of the internal policy 1991 in order to ensure that each parameter:
               • is clearly defined,
               • is meaningful for default and impairment detection,
               • can be obtained or calculated within a reasonable timeframe.
Recommendation The Bank shall demonstrate that any change to the list of parameters does not weaken the default detection process and the recognition of impairments. In addition, the Bank is
               requested to clearly define in its policies any possible exception to reclassifications required by the binding parameters. The new policy and process must not allow exceptions to
               reclassification when binding parameters are activated, unless the exception is clearly defined in the policy. The Bank is also requested to improve its processes to ensure that also
               low priority non-binding parameters are promptly assessed. Concerning the timely processing of binding parameters, the Bank is requested to ensure that, for binding parameters
               derived from the regulation (…), their activation must necessarily lead to reclassification regardless of the status of the parameter at the time of the analysis. In order to assess the
               timely analysis of the binding parameters, the Bank is requested to submit to the ECB, on quarterly basis, a report highlighting the timing for the assessment of binding parameters.
               The report must contain, at minimum:
               • the minimum, median and maximum days to process binding parameters per month of activation,
               • the actions taken to reduce delays, if any.
               In addition, the Bank is requested to communicate the annual reclassification rate, at debtor level, of debtors hit by at least one non-binding impairment trigger. Furthermore,
               internal audit shall conduct a yearly examination of a representative sample of the latter population, and communicate the results to the ECB. The quarterly report must be
               submitted also to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The relevant extract of the minutes where the report is discussed shall be submitted to the ECB. Furthermore, the
               Bank is requested to assess how to align ISA - “Indicatore Sintetico di Anomalia” - and ISA_P - ISA Evoluto – to incorporate all the changes driven by the recommendation
               contained in this letter.
