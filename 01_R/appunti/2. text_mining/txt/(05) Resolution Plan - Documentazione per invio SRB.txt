                                  TA
            Gli interventi richiesti da SRB e concordati durante il Workshop del 3 luglio 2018
            riguardano principalmente l’identificazione di tutti gli eventuali ostacoli
                                    ZI
            operativi/finanziari/IT legati alla trasferibilità di qualsiasi attività/entity in caso di

            assolvere una risoluzione ordinata all’interno del c.d. “Resolution Weekend” si
            elencano di seguito i principali impedimenti emersi dall’analisi di Separability:
          ME- Impedimenti Operativi
                  Principalmente derivano dall’accentramento presso la Capogruppo dei servizi
             N    critici. In particolare, le difficoltà operative possono derivare dalla presenza di
                  servizi forniti in accentrato dalla Capogruppo alle società del Gruppo (i.e.
                  strutture di controllo, servizi contabili e amministrativi); in caso di avvio della
                  risoluzione attraverso uno strumento di separability, sarebbe necessario
 CU               suddividere le strutture accentrate per rendere autonome le società (o i rami di
                  azienda) che vengono separate. Inoltre, le interconnessioni alla base del
                  funzionamento delle funzioni critiche potrebbero essere altresì considerate come

            - Impedimenti Legali:
                  Da tale punto di vista dell’analisi, non emergono particolari impedimenti alla

                  Tuttavia, nella ricerca di una possibile Alternative Resolution Strategy, bisogna
                  considerare che la configurazione come Gruppo bancario, la presenza di MLE, di
                  critical functions all’interno delle stesse e/o di branches soggette ad impianti
                  giuridici differenti (i.e. extra-EU) potrebbero essere fonte di ritardi nelle

                  tempistiche di esecuzione degli strumenti di risoluzione (i.e. in ottica sale of
                  business, la gestione della vendita di più MLE risulta più complessa rispetto alla
                  fattispecie in cui fosse presente una sola MLE).
             N
            - Impedimenti Finanziari:
                  Nessun ostacolo finanziario è stato rilevato. Un punto di attenzione potrebbe
                  riguardare la presenza dell’accordo di liquidità (“Liquidity waiver”) tra le entità
 CU               del Gruppo e la Capogruppo. La decadenza dell'accordo, a seguito dell’eventuale
                  entrata in risoluzione dell’ente, potrebbe generare una carenza di liquidità per le
                  società controllate del Gruppo mettendo a rischio la continuità operativa.

    attraverso un modello di scoring ha confermato che lo strumento del Bail-In, già individuato dal SRB, risulti essere la strategia di risoluzione preferibile (Preferred Resolution
    Strategy - PRS) nell’ottica di garantire una risoluzione ordinata. Tale analisi, unitamente alle conclusioni emerse nell’ambito della separability, ha anche evidenziato che il tool «sale of
    the business» risulti essere la strategia di risoluzione alternativa per il Gruppo (Alternative Resolution Strategy – ARS).

                 In conclusione, si evidenzia che, nonostante l’analisi di fattibilità abbia visto una lieve preferenza verso il Bridge Bank, la sostanziale assenza di impatti a livello sistemico dati dall’applicazione del
                 Sale of Business compensa in modo più che proporzionale i risultati della prima parte di analisi. A tal proposito si evidenzia che la strategia del Sale of Business risulterebbe quella ottimale dal
DO               punto di vista sistemico anche in confronto al Bail-in e all’Asset Separation: Sale of Business = 2,11; Bridge Bank = 2,39; Asset Separation = 4,14; Bail in = 4,65.

  Vantaggi:
  <U+F071> L’individuazione di un’unica Resolution Strategy consentirebbe al Gruppo di focalizzare le analisi inerenti alla resolvability verso una strategia orientata al Bail-In e, pertanto,
       ridurrebbe la necessità di effettuare interventi atti alla rimozione degli impedimenti agli altri 3 tool (soprattutto di natura operativa e IT).
  Prossimi Passi:
DO<U+F071> Il Gruppo ha presentato al SRB la metodologia sopra descritta ed i relativi risultati, che si è espresso positivamente, lasciandosi comunque un breve periodo di tempo per eventuali
       approfondimenti. Il Gruppo è quindi in attesa di un feedback formale da parte del SRB circa la solidità dei risultati raggiunti con particolare riguardo alla Preferred Resolution Strategy
       (il Bail-In) ed eventualmente all’ Alternative Resolution Strategy (il Sales of Business) così da poter valutare l’avvio delle attività propedeutiche a supportarne l’applicazione.

             Contesto
1   Il SRB all’interno delle richieste afferenti al workshop del 3 luglio 2018 ha richiesto al Gruppo un’analisi propedeutica ad evidenziare i principali impedimenti di natura IT, legale, operativa e finanziaria per
    l’applicazione dei tool di resolution afferenti alla separability.
        Obiettivo del SRB
2   All’interno dell’analisi di Resolvability, il SRB mira ad individuare possibili impedimenti all’applicazione di una Resolution Strategy (PRS o ARS). Laddove dovessero emergere sostanziali impedimenti
                           NT
    all’applicazione di un tool di risoluzione, è nei poteri dell’Autorità di Risoluzione chiedere al Gruppo di rimuoverli/adeguarsi.
             Perimetro
3                            AZ
    Il Gruppo ha concentrato le proprie analisi alle Material Legal Entities rilevate nell’ambito del Recovery Plan (MPS, CS, L&F, Widiba) ed il Consorzio Operativo di Gruppo. Con riferimento alle Legal Entities
    rimanenti sono state evidenziate unicamente gli highlights in materia di separability.
    L’analisi ha riguardato sia la cessione per intero di una delle Material Legal Entities che la cessione di un ramo e più rami d’azienda afferenti alle Critical Function.
      Data di Riferimento
4   I dati di natura finanziaria sono rilevati al 31 dicembre 2017 (in linea con le richieste di approfondimento di cui al workshop del 3 luglio 2018).
    CU
    Sono stati inoltre riportati i main facts emersi nel corso del 2018.
    Descrizione Deliverable

      ME
    Il documento si divide in 3 principali sezione:
    1. Una sezione di premessa, dove vengono riportati obiettivi, contesto di riferimento e una descrizione circa la struttura del Gruppo, il business model e l’orgnaigramma.
    2. Una sezione dove per ogni società/ramo d’azienda oggetto di analisi (si veda perimetro) sono stati riportati gli impedimenti di natura IT, operativi, finanziari e legali. In tale ambito sono state anche
         considerate possibili manifestazioni di interesse espresse dal mercato. Di seguito si riportano i principali driver utilizzati nelle analisi:
             • In ambito legale, la presenza o meno di patti parasociali
             • In ambito IT, eventuali impedimenti di natura applicativi e/o tempistiche legate alla migrazione dei sistemi ed i relativi costi;
             • In ambito operativo, la presenza di Accordi quadro in insourcing oppure in outsourcing;
             • In ambito finanziario, la presenza di eventuali interconnessioni di natura finanziari (ad esempio dati di raccolta infragruppo, garanzie ecc. ecc.).
DO  3. Una terza sezione di sintesi dedicata alle conclusioni.

 In 2014, the EU established an orderly cross-border resolution mechanism via the Bank Recovery and

 Resolution Directive (BRRD), which provides resolution authorities with comprehensive powers and
 resolution tools to intervene when a bank meets the conditions for resolution. Resolution authorities
 have to prepare resolution plans detailing how a bank will be resolved, in a way that achieves the
 resolution objectives, while ensuring that taxpayers avoid carrying the burden, as was the case in the
                                                                       MI

 the application of Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs).
 The SRM is one of the pillars of the Banking Union, alongside the SSM. As of November 2014, the SSM
 is the new system of banking supervision in the Banking Union, comprising the European Central Bank

 The organisational developments in 2017 were characterised by the completion of initiatives to
 redefine scopes of responsibility, delineated by the new organisational model approved by the Board
 of Directors in the 4th quarter of 2016 and, during that period, was limited to the first reporting level
 and the first step in the organisational reconfiguration of the CCO and CHCO areas.
                                               IO
 In addition to completing the deployment of the new organisational model that involved nearly all of
 the Parent Company’s areas of responsibility, although with differing degrees of depth and impacts,
 other optimisation initiatives were planned and carried out that, for the relevant areas, contributed to
 developing a framework design consistent with the reference philosophy that was the source of
          ME
 inspiration in terms of focused and clear assignment of responsibilities, simplification of structures and
 processes, strengthening of governance mechanisms and specialised oversights, as well as
 organisational suitability in relation to the provisions of supervisory bodies and designed to facilitate
 the realisation of the Bank’s Restructuring Plan agreed with the competent authorities.

           Impediments
 In the Resolution cycle, impediments can be interpretated as obstacles that prevent the separability
 because making harder the application of the Resolution Tools. However, before to discussing the
            NT
 impediments that could arise for the Parent Compony of the Group – BMPS in a separability scenario,
 it needs to consider the all legal, financial, operational and IT internal and external interconnections
 as of 31 December 2017 among BMPS, the other entities of the Group and the outsourcing services
              AZ
 provider.
 An other impediment to consider is the “expression of the interest by the market”. This term refers to
 the interest that the market expresses about the subsiadiares of the Group. Particullary, in the last two
 years expressions of interest have not been received from to the Group for BMPS.
 6.1.3.1 Legal Impediments
 A legal impediment can be interpretated as an obstacle that prevent the separability because of intra-

 Before discussing the potential financial impediments, below a short description of the financial

 interconnections as at 31/12/2017, that could cause Financial impediments.
 Financial interconnections
 The parent company is responsible for providing financial support to the subsidiaries in order to allow
                                                                        MI
 them to fulfill all their obligations. In this regard, the parent company and all the Italian subsidiaries
 (MPS CS, Widiba S.p.A. and MPS L&F) subscribed binding agreements that imply for the free circulation
 of funds within BMPS’ Group (“Liquidity framework agreements – Accordo quadro per la fornitura del
                                                                           T
 supporto di liquidità infragruppo”) without limits in terms of amount and timing. According to the
 liquidity framework agreements, the parent company will provide the subsidiaries with all the financial
 resources they need to timely meet their financial obligations through any of the following financial
 facilities:
        -   Interbank accounts;
        -
        -
            time deposits;
            REPOs.                                       NE
 Group companies can ask debit or credit mutual accounts with the Parent Company without limit, in
 order to meet short-term liquidity requirements, while time deposits are met for structural or medium-
                                               IO
 long term liquidity needs. Finally, if the Group’s subsidiaries have a securities portfolio, they can
 finance with the Parent company via repo transactions.
 Financial support agreements also allow for direct lending between Italian subsidiaries with financial
 surplus and subsidiaries with financial deficit. In any case, intra-group liquidity flows take place under
            ME
 the supervision and direction of the Parent Company’s Group Liquidity Management Unit.
 In particular, if an Italian subsidiary is hit by a liquidity stress/crisis, unexpected liquidity needs may
 be satisfied by borrowing from another Group entity debiting intra-group accounts, as instructed by
 the Parent Company.
              NT
 The liquidity needs faced by foreign Entities (Monte Paschi Belgio, Monte Paschi Banque) are offset by
 the liquidity lines granted by the Parent Company and sized according to their balance sheet and
 business.
                AZ
 These liquidity lines do not prevent the Parent Company from providing additional funding to the
 foreign Companies, if needed.
 If the liquidity situation of a subsidiary causes a crisis/stress situation for the Parent Company, this will
 be managed by the Liquidity Stress/Crisis Committee, as established in the Regulation 1 - Organization
 of BMPS Bank.

 In case of separation of one or more Parent Company’s critical functions (Lending or Deposit and
 Payments), all the above operational internal and external interconnections, could generate potential
 operational impediments because of the dissolution of the contracts that regulate the supplying of
 critical services.
                                                                     CO
 Regarding internal interconnections, i.e. result that there are 184 employees (as of 31/12/2017) of
 MPS CS that work for BMPS providing specific services and that in order to comply the trade unions
 procedure from CCNL art 17 par. 7 and art.21, should be reintegrated in MPS CS.
 6.1.3.4 IT impediments

 Concerning IT interconnections, there could be impediments related to the timing and costs of the
                                                                           T
 migration of the Information Tech System. In particular, transfer operations are guided by the
 transferor, normally, for layouts and technical logics of releases; in the event that the originator also
 has to normalise the data, potential problems could result, whose complexity and estimate of effort is
 difficult to quantify and not included in the present assessment. In a base scenario, costs could be
 between 3 – 3,5 €/mln, while timing should be between ten and fifteen months.
                                                         NE
 The quantification of costs and timing refers to hypothesis of a stand-alone operation.
 More operations carried out at the same time could result in an increase in time and costs that can not
 be quantified.

 In case of separability of BMP CS all the above internal and external operational interconnectedness
 could cause operational impediments.
                                                                                    T
 In case of total asset disposal of the Parent Company, all the above operational interconnections
 between MPS CS and BMPS, in terms of services provided by BMPS, could be potential operational
 impediments, including the 54 employees (as of 31/12/2017) of BMPS that working for MPS CS that in
 order to comply the trade unions procedure from CCNL art. 17 par. 7 and art.21, should be reintegrated
 in BMPS. Instead, in the case of one critical function was dismissed, the trade unions procedure from
                                                          NE
 CCNL art 17 c. par. 7 and art.21 have to be apply only for the employees of the critical function object
 of separability
 Concerning Back Office, the total asset disposal could generate operational impediments in terms of
 higher costs for the services provided from outsourcer. In fact, in this case the Group could not exploit
 economies of scale and for this reason there will be the necessary to rinegoziate the agreements.
                                                IO
 Instead, if one critical function was dismissed the impact in term of higher costs will be lower.
 Finally, on condition that the Regulatory does not allow derogations, the dissolution of the “Waiver
 Liquidity” agreement could cause the needs for MPS CS to centralize a system for the supervisory
          ME
 reporting for the liquidity and create a Treasury-ALM section.
 6.2.3.4 IT impediments
 Concerning IT interconnections, there could be impediments related to the timing and costs about the
            NT
 migration of the Information Technology System. In particular, transfer operations are guided by the
 transferor, normally, for layouts and technical logics of releases. In the event that the originator also
 has to normalise the data, potential troubles could result, whose complexity and estimate of effort is
              AZ
 difficult to quantify and not included in the present assessment. The quantification of costs and time
 refers to hypothesis of a stand-alone operation and is reported below.
      - In the case of total asset disposal costs and timing are rispectivelly 600 €/k – 800 €/k in six –
           nine months;
      - In the case of disposal of critical function (Capital Market own behalf Treding) costs and timing
           are rispectivelly 500 €/k – 650 €/k in six – nine months;
      - In the case of disposal of not critical function costs and timing are rispectivelly 300 €/k – 400
 CU        €/k in six – nine months
 Furthermore, More operations carried out at the same time could result in an increase in timing and
 costs that can not be quantified.

 INTRODUCTION

 After Gruppo Montepaschi received on the 24th April 2018 del SRB the communication letter “Adoption for
 the Group Resolution Plan and Summary of the Key Elements for Monte dei Paschi di Siena”, the SRB
 individuated as preferred Resolution Strategy for the Group Monte dei Paschi di Siena (from now on GMPS)
 the Bail-In. Therefore, following the receipt of the Working Priorities, as part of the A - Resolution Strategy
                                                                     CO
 module, the Group, upon specific request by the SRB, conducted an analysis aimed at evaluating the
 Preferred Resolution Strategy and an Alternative Resolution Strategy.
     Objective
                                                                        MI
 The document is aimed to individuate the Variant (or Alternative) Resolution Strategy and to test the
 Preferred Resolution Strategy (defined by the SRB) for the Group MPS, in order to minimize the possible
                                                                           T
 impacts on the market and guarantee a fast and effective resolution for the Group. The GMPS already
 received a preferred resolution strategy from the SRB, so through this document the objective of the Group
 is to test whether the suggested preferred resolution Strategy is actually the one which minimizes the impact
 on the Financial System and is the most feasible in terms of applicability and to detect an Alternative
 resolution Strategy in case of supervening impossibility of the Preferred Resolution Strategy. The present

 carried out by the Bank.
 In particular, the document is composed as follow:

 2. KEY ELEMENTS OF RESOLUTION STRATEGY ANALYSIS
      Regulatory framework overview

 In 2014, the EU established an orderly cross-border resolution mechanism via the Bank Recovery and
 Resolution Directive (BRRD), which provides resolution authorities with comprehensive powers and
 resolution tools to intervene when a bank meets the conditions for resolution. Resolution authorities have
 to prepare resolution plans detailing how a bank will be resolved, in a way that achieves the resolution
                                                                         MI
 objectives, while ensuring taxpayers avoid carrying the burden, as was the case in the recent crisis.
 The BRRD, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD), the European Commission (EC) Delegated Acts,
 prepared on the basis of Technical Standards drafted by the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the EBA’s
                                                                            T
 Guidelines, form a single rulebook for the EU to the scope of resolution planning, execution and the
 application of Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs).
 The SRM is one of the pillars of the Banking Union, alongside the SSM. As of November 2014, the SSM is the
 new system of banking supervision in the Banking Union, comprising the European Central Bank (ECB) and
 national supervisory authorities of the participating Member States (National Competent Authorities). Under
                                                         NE
 the SRM, centralised decision-making power in respect of resolution has been entrusted to the SRB, which
 derives its powers from both the BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism(SRM).

      Background
 In order to further advance the resolution plan for Gruppo Monte dei Paschi, the SRB requested to work on
               AZ
 “Variant Resolution Strategies” (Working Priority B.3), with the objective of contribute to the operalization
 of the resolution strategy and to the development of variant resolution strategies. The actions planned by
 the Bank in order to comply with this request includes:
 18 the power to reduce, including to reduce to zero, the principal amount of or outstanding amount due in respect of eligible
 CU
 liabilities, of an institution under resolution;
 19 the power to amend or alter the maturity of debt instruments and other eligible liabilities issued by an institution under
 resolution or amend the amount of interest payable under such instruments and other eligible liabilities, or the date on which the
 interest becomes payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period, except for secured liabilities subject to Article
 44(2);

 Starting from the legal, operational, financial and IT impediments identified in a Separability and in a Bail-in
 view, each of the four resolution tools has been analyzed and evaluated within two different analysis:
     a) Feasibility;
          ME
     b) Impact on financial system;
 The impediments/ impacts identified have been divided into six different clusters and fifteen subclusters,
 derived from the document “The Single Resolution Mechanism” - «Introduction to Resolution Planning» -
 SRB.
            NT
 The feasibility of the application of a resolution tool has been evaluated considering the timing and the
 related costs:
     -    «High» scoring if it significantly undermines the feasibility
              AZ
     -    «Medium» scoring if it slightly undermines the feasibility
     -    «Low» scoring in case it slows down the application of the tool without undermining the feasibility
     -    «Null» scoring to the impediment in case it does not affect the feasibility of the Tool
 The impact on financial system following the application of a resolution tool has been evaluated
 considering the counterparty involved:

 3. EVALUATION DRIVERS OF RESOLUTION TOOLS

 The methodology, identified by GMPS, for the predisposition of the «Resolution Strategy Analysis» is aimed
 at evaluating a possible alternative to the Preferred Resolution Strategy (PRS). Starting from the four
                                                                      CO
 resolution Tools: Sale of the Business, Bridge Institution, Asset Separation and Bail-in, it has been developed
 a dicotomial scoring model which allows to quantify the impediments for each one of the resolution tools
 under six different clusters and fifteen subclusters, derived from the document “The Single Resolution
 Mechanism” - «Introduction to Resolution Planning» - SRB.
                                                                         MI
 The Group detected the main possible impediments to the possible application of each tool, arising from its
 charateristics; a value of “1” is assigned if the impediment is realized, otherwise a value of 0 is assigned if
                                                                            T
 the impediment is not realized or it is realized but does not affect the feasibility of the resolution tool.
 In correspondence with each impediment is assigned a judgmental weight based on the magnitude of the
 impediment (high, medium, low). The weights are so determined: «Null» scoring to the impediment in case
 it does not affect the feasibility of the Tool, «Low» scoring in case it slows down the application of the tool
                                                         NE
 without undermining the feasibility, «Medium» scoring if it slightly undermines the feasibility and «High»
 scoring if it significantly undermines the feasibility. The weight «Null» corresponds to a scoring of zero, the
 weight «Low» corresponds to a scoring of one, the weight «Medium» corresponds to a scoring of two, while
 the weight «High» has a scoring of three. Each cluster will receive a scoring, which will reflect how much the
 cluster is affected by the impediments, through a weighted average of the dicotomial scorings assigned to
                                               IO
 each driver times the weight given to each one of the impediments. By doing so, the resolution tool which
 will receive the lowest scoring will be considered the more feasible for the Group.
 The same methodology it has been used for quantifying the impacts on the financial system, but the drivers
          ME
 used are different, as well as the weight assigning method. In this case, indeed there will not be an
 exstimation of the impediments, but an exstimation of the impacts’ drivers.
 The Group detected the main possible impacts on financial system caused by the application of one of the
            NT
 tools. A value of 1 is assigned if the impact occurs, otherwise a value of 0 is assigned if the impact does not
 arise or it realizes but it has no impact on financial system. Therefore this model is aimed at quantifying which
 drivers impact on the Financial System in case of the application of a resolution tool. Each driver receives a
 weight basing on its severity, penetration and capillarity. The weights are so determined: «Null» scoring to
              AZ
 the driver in case it does not have effects on the Financial System, a «Low» scoring in case it has a low impact
 in terms of penetration/capillarity and type of counterparties affected a «Medium» score if in case of a
 medium impact and a «High» score in case of a high impact. The weight «Null» corresponds to a scoring of
 zero, the weight «Low» corresponds to a scoring of one, the weight «Medium» corresponds to a scoring of
 two, while the weight «High» has a scoring of three. The scoring for each cluster is obtained by multiplying
 each impediment for its weight and arithmetically averaging the result.The Resolution tool which will receive
 CU
 the lowest scoring will be considered the less systemically impacting for the Group.

 The number of evaluation drivers for each cluster is not homogeneous and varies from zero to six. The higher
 the number of drivers in a cluster, the higher the possible impediments/impacts. For the first cluster, Bank
 structure, three subclusters have been identified concerning: the Legal Structure of the Bank, Ownership and
 Governance. The second cluster is divided into four subclusters: Balance Sheet, Income Statement,
                                               IO
 Regulatory requirements and Funding Plan – Minimum requirement for ownfunds and eligible liabilities
 (from now on MREL) – Loss Absorbing Capacity (from now on LAC). The third cluster is divided in two
 subclusters: Business Model and Business Lines as well as the fourth, which is divided in Core business Lines
 and Critical Functions. The fifth cluster is aimed to individuate the impediments/impacts deriving from the
           ME
 interdependencies, and therefore is divided into: Internal and External interdependencies and finally the last
 cluster is divided in IT Systems and Financial market Infrastructures(from now on FMI) access.

 Legal Structure
 Within the sub-cluster “Legal Structure” four impediments to the application of Resolution tools and two
 impacts on Financial system have been identified.
               AZ
 Feasibility Analysis
 The four possible impediments individuated derive from the configuration of the Bank as a Group, the
 presence of material legal entities within the Group according to the Article 7 of BRRD and its legal
 configuration under different legislations, inside and outside of the European Union. In fact the drivers that
 were identified by the Group are aimed at exstimating the additional complexity deriving from the
 configuration of the Institution as a group, being more immediate to put under Resolution a single entity
 CU
 than a group. The additional complexity implied in having inside the group more than one Material Legal
 Entity (from now on MLE) is mainly arising in case of Separability tools, having to preserve the critical
 functions as well as the core business lines and the FMIs. The third impediment detected is aimed at

 such as MPS Belgium and MPS France. These subsidiaries are indeed regulated by different national laws,
 which may create an additional complexity in case of Resolution. Additional complexity would have been also
 added in case of presence of material legal entities outside the European Union.
 Financial System Impacts

 Within the financial system Impacts analysis the drivers identified for the subcluster “Legal Structure” are
 two. The first one verifies the existence of Legal Entities outside the European Union, which would lead to a
 greater contagion in case of failure of the Group. While the second driver questions whether the Group has
 legal Entities with a market Share > 2% in a foreign country, being this driver also associated to greater
                                                                        MI
 capillarity and severity in terms of effects on the financial system.
 Ownership

 Within the sub-cluster “Ownership” one impediment to the application of Resolution tools and one impact
 on Financial system have been identified.
 Feasibility Analysis
 For the sub-cluster “Ownership”, the only detected driver with an impact on the feasibility of the Resolution
                                                         NE
 tools is the existence of Shareholders agreements, which could restrict/slower the implementation of a
 resolution tool.
 Financial System Impacts
 With reference to the financial system impacts analysis, within the “Ownership” subcluster the grade of
                                               IO
 involvement of the retail and SME sector in the ownership of the Institution has been detected as a driver in
 case of application of a resolution tool. This variable, indeed is very important to measure the impacts on
 real economy, helping quantifying the impact on the non-qualified sectors of economy deriving from the
 application of the tool in the cost of the burden coverage.
          ME
 Governance
 Within the sub-cluster “Governance” one impediment to the application of Resolution tools and one impact
 on Financial system have been identified.
            NT
 Feasibility Analysis
 The impediment detected is the Significant Influence of the Italian Government on the Bank’s governance,
 which could dissuade a potential buyer from buying the Bank, being an impediment to the Separability tools,
              AZ
 which strongly depend on the will of a third party to buy the Bank. The potential buyer, in case of a partial
 acquisition may not want the Government to interfere on the governance related decisions and therefore
 give up on buying the Bank.
 Financial System Impacts
 The Presence of the State among the Shareholders is instead a driver of financial System impacts because of
 the subjects who would have to bear the losses in case of the application of a resolution tool, indeed all the
 CU
 effects wil be reflected on the State and indirectly on the citiziens.

 In the “Balance Sheet” subcluster two impediments to the application of a Resolution strategy and four
 impacts on the financial system have been detected.
                                                                        CO
 Feasibility Analysis
 The first impediment detected is “Balance Sheet configuration not coherent with the Liquidity needs in case
 of Resolution”, which could be an impediment in case of application of a resolution tool because the Bank
 would be forced to find liquidity in in a short time through market-based financing or by selling assets
                                                                           MI
 allegedly at fire sale prices. Another impediment detected is the “Presence of Multioriginator Securitised
 assets in the Balance Sheet of the Bank”, which would imply a higher difficulty in the Resolution process,
 being these kind of assets particularly time-consuming to break down and therefore they may slower the
 process.
 Financial System Impacts
                                                                              T
 The first of the four impact’s drivers is “Total Asset Ranked among the highest 20 in Europe”, it is aimed to
 test the magnitude and capillarity of the impact on the financial system given by the potential failure of the
                                                         NE
 bank. Indeed, being ranked among the 20 bigger banks in Europe would imply having operations in various
 countries and therefore an higher number of depositors and stakeholders in the whole continent. To quantify
 the impact and capillarity it has been introduced another driver ”Total Asset Ranked among the highest 10
 in Italy” which is aimed to verify whether the Bank is ranked among the biggest 10 in Italy. The third driver is
 “Geographical concentation of the credit exposures”, calculated as exposures toward a single region divided
                                               IO
 by total exposures. The exposures are considered concentrated if more than the 20% of total exposures are
 concentrated in a single region. The concentration towards a single region would imply that the region would
 be particularly damaged by the failure of the Bank and therefore the impact on the real economy in that
 region would be particularly high. The last driver considered in this sub-cluster is the ”sectorial concentration
          ME
 of credit exposures”, calculated as exposures toward a single sector divided by total exposures. The
 exposures are considered concentrated if more than the 20% of total exposures are concentrated in a single
 sector. If this is the case the sector would be very vulnerable to a possible failure of the Bank.
            NT
 Income statement
 In the “Income statement” subcluster two impediments to the application of a Resolution strategy and one
 impact on the financial system have been detected.
              AZ
 Feasibility Analysis
 The presence of “Legal Entities of the Group with current and prospective negative profitability” can be an
 impediment to the separability tools, dissuading potential buyers from buying the entity because of the
 expected negative results. The second impediment driver is instead linked to the cost structure, indeed
 having costs higher than peers’ average would make the group unefficient and could be an impediment to
 separability tools as well as to Bail-in, because the inefficiency of cost structure reflects on the appetibility of
 CU
 the Bank and in the ease to carry the Bank under a process of insolvency with a shortage of funds.

 As impact on the financial system it has been identified “Cost cutting deriving from potential industry

 economy, leaving a significant number of people unemployed, as consequence of the cost optimization.
 Regulatory Requirements
 For the subcluster “Regulatory Requirements” five impediments to the application of a resolution strategy
 and two impacts on financial system have been detected.
 Feasibility Analysis

 The capital need satisfaction is analysed under two different perspectives: the Group’s capital adequacy in
                                                                         MI
 relation with the current and prospective needs on a consolidated basis and the single MLEs’ capital adequacy
 in relation with the current and prospective needs on a single basis. Both these variables are important to
 allow the feasibility of a resolution tool. Indeed the capital inadequacy strongly affects the eventual
                                                                            T
 recapitalization of an entity and it also makes the legal entity impossible to sell for regulatory reasons. Other
 variables analysed are the operational and structural liquidity inadequacy, which might be an indicator of
 liquidity shortage as well as a source of uncompliance with the current Basel III Framework. Finally the last
 impediment driver is “Liquidity Inadequacy in relation with the current and prospectic needs for the MLEs”,
 which might be an impediment in terms of feasibility of the tools causing a prospective shortage of funds for
 the legal entities.
 Financial System Impacts                                NE
 In the financial system impact Analysis have been detected as size and relevance indicators the “classification
 of the Group as a G-SII” or the “classification of the Group as O-SII or higher”, being indicators of the systemic
                                               IO
 relevance of the Bank and therefore indicators of the magnitude of an impact on the financial system.
 Funding Plan - MREL – LAC
 Within the subcluster “Funding Plan-MREL-LAC” two impediments to the application of a resolution strategy
          ME
 and two impacts on financial system have been detected.
 Feasibility Analysis
 As impediment to the feasibility of Resolution tools it has been identified firstly the “Liabilities Structure not
            NT
 coherent with Interim Target MREL”, being it a new indicator to satisfy, which will be binding for the Group
 in 2021, the Group will have to be ready to satisfy this additional requirement in order to be compliant with
 the regulatory framework. As second impediment to the feasibility, an “high level of asset encumberance in
 relation with the standard levels set by the Liquidity Crisis Framework in case of Resolution” has been
              AZ
 considered a factor of additional complexity for the application of a tool because of the fact that a lower level
 of assets available to face a crisis situation may lead to additional complexity.
 Financial System Impacts
 In the identification of the financial system impacts’ drivers the type of the counterparties holding the LAC
 instruments issued by the Bank are considered. Indeed a distinction is made between the instruments held
 by the Retail/SME sector, which in case of Bail-in would lose a big amount of their value, impacting on the
 CU
 less-qualified sector of the economy and the instruments held by institutional counterparties, which could
 affect indirectly a wide number of people.

 Feasibility Analysis
 The feasibility analyisis of business lines has been based on the determination of the configuration of the
 Bank’s business model as a Universal Bank model or focused on a single line of products, a distinction has
 been made between the Group’s Business model, the Bank’s business model and the subsidiaries’ business
                                                                        MI
 model, being them different in terms of functions covered and variety of functions embed in the legal entities.
 Therefore it will be easier to put under resolution a non universal bank respect to an universal bank in terms
 of separability.

 In the feasibility analysis the “Presence of two or more critical Functions” is considered a driver of additional
 complexity, mostly in the separation tools, where the critical functions must be preserved to prevent possible

 impacts on the financial stability and therefore they must be considered in order to assess the separability of
 the group. The “Presence of Critical Functions within the subsidiaries” would extend the analysis not only to
 the Parent Company, but also to the subsidiaries. The last driver analyzed is “Interconnections between
 Critical functions”, indeed in case of interconnections the interruption of a critical function, even if temporary
 would affect the functioning of another critical function and so having significant effects on the Bank and on
 the financial system.
 Financial System Impacts                                NE
 Among the three financial system impact drivers identified, two or them are aimed to judge the materiality
 of the critical functions in term of market share and market volume. The higher these variables, the higher
                                               IO
 impacts will be borne by the financial system. Relevant to the scope of the analysis has also been considered
 the non sostitutability of critical functions, which depends on the additional supply on the banking market of
 analogue functions which could replace the critical functions currently conducted by the Bank.

 Feasibility Analysis
              AZ
 The first impediment detected in the feasibility analysis is the presence of intragroup contracts of centralized
 financial support (Waiver Liquidity), indeed, this agreement makes the Parent Company responsible of
 supplying liquidity to all the Legal entities of group. In case of a partial sale of the business, the sold legal
 entity should receive the liquidity from another Entity. Other impediments are considered the presence of
 non critical SLA between the parent company and the material legal entities and viceversa, although not
 critical, these contracts may slower the application of a resolution tool. More severe are expected to be the
 CU
 impacts deriving from the presence of critical SLAs concerning the Control Functions, which are centralized
 in the Group. In case of separability indeed the legal entities should provide themselves with a own control
 function according to the normative 285/Title 1/Chapter 1/Annex A.

 As feasibility impact it has been identified “The presence of critical SLAs between the MLEs and other
 subjects” because in case of the application of a resolution tool, the SLAs with third parties may be
 interrupted, causing the termination of the contract and the same situation is applicable to the non critical
                                                                           T
 SLAs between MLEs and other subjects. Additional complexity may be derived by “Liabilities Concentration
 towards SME/retail counterparties for the legal Entities under Resolution”, which in case of bail-in would be
 a problem given that the retail/SME counterparties are less qualified and weaker, therefore a higher amount
 of consequences is produced.

 An impact on the financial system may be derived by the “Concentration of Assets/Liabilities towards public
 counterparties (e.g. Hospitals, City Halls)”, because the application of a possible resolution tool may affect
 the value of the assets/liablities deposited by the public counterparties involved, creating an effect on the
 counterparty that would be reflected on the “customers” of this public counterparty.

 of the “Consorzio Operativo di Gruppo” the Parent company should provide itself with another supplier of
 Informative Data Sets and so it should transfer to the new supplier all the data concerning. The other two
 impediments identified concern the need to replicate the front-end/backlog applications in case of change

 Concerning the feasibility analysis, the presence of FMI non-promptly replaceable supporting the functioning
 of Critical Functions is an impediment because the operativity of critical functions should be assured at any
 time to avoid producing negative effects on the functioning of the Bank, given their particular importance.

 The scorings assigned each the subcluster in the presentation of the results also affere to the typology of
 impediment to which each corresponds. Specifically the scoring of the Legal impediments have been
 obtained by averaging arithmetically the scoring assigned to the subclusters Legal Structure, Ownership and
 CU
 Governance.

 Looking at the results of the Feasibility Analysis, according to the Model, in terms of feasibility, the preferred
 tool is the Bail-In, to which the lowest scoring is assigned, followed by Asset Separation,Bridge Institution and
 Sale of Business.
                AZ
 Indeed the Bail-in has the lowest scoring for the Legal, Operational and IT type of impediments, while it has
 the highest scoring in terms of Financial Impediments, in this typology the easiest tool to apply is the Sale of
 the Business, which in the final ranking is the least preferred strategy in terms of feasibility.
 The results of this analysis show a strong preference towards the application of Bail-in respect to the other
 strategies. The result of the first best tool is indeed very far from the second best, the Asset Separation which
 CU
 is instead not so far from the third best,the Bridge Institution and the least preferred, the Sale of the Business.

 From the table above it is possible to see that, in this scenario, the preferred tool is the Sale of the Business,
           ME
 followed by the Bridge Institution, the Asset Separation and Bail-in.
 The sale of the Business is preferred in all types of Impediments clusters, except for the IT type of impacts, in
 which the preferred tool is the Bail-in, which, in the final ranking is the least preferred strategy in terms of
             NT
 financial system analysis.
 The final results shows a strong preference towards the Sale of the Business Tool, followed closely by the
 Bridge Institution, while the other two tools, the Asset Separation and the Bail-In are far in terms of results
               AZ
 from the first two alternatives.

 Looking at the results of the aggregate Analysis, according to the Model, in terms of Feasibility and
 Financial System Impacts, the preferred tool is the Bail-In, to which the lowest scoring is assigned, followed
 by Sale of Business, Asset Separation and Bridge Institution.
             NT
 Indeed the Bail-in has the lowest scoring for the Operational and the IT type of impediments, while it has
 the highest scoring in terms of Legal Impediments. In this typology of impediments the most feasible/less
 impacting tool is the Bridge Institution, which in the final ranking is placed at the third position, while for
 what concerns the Financial impediments/impacts the preferred tool is the Sale of the business, ranked at
 the second position.
               AZ
 The results of this analysis show a strong preference towards the application of Bail-in respect to the other
 strategies. The result is indeed very far from the second best, the Sale of the Business, which is instead not
 so far from the third best,the Bridge Institution, instead the least preferred tool, the Asset Separation is by
 far the last in terms of aggregate of feasibility and financial system impacts and this results is also caused by
 the fact that the Asset Separation Tool can not be applied singularly, but has to be applied after another
 tool.

 In conclusion, the above described methodology, used by the Bank, has highlighted that the preferred
 Resolution Strategy is the Bail-In, as previously decided by the SRB, while the alternative strategy to be
 implemented in case of supervening impossibility of the preferred one is the Sale of Business.
                                                                      CO
 As previously said indeed the results show a strong preference towards the Bail-in tool, while the separability
 tools present more relevant impediments to the application of the tool/impacts on financial system. Among
 the separability tools, in fact, the Sale of the Business is slightly preferred than the Bridge Separation, while
 the Asset Separation is by far the least preferred.
