•  Starting from 28th November 2017 an organisational change took place which foresees the centralisation in the CDD Unit of the high risk clients due diligence. Such activities were previously performed whithin the Territorial
   Commercial Offices and the intervention of the CDD Unit was only in case of further assessment needed. The organisational change also increased the CDD Unit by 10 staff previously assigned to the Territorial Commercial
   Offices. Furthermore, the CDD Unit evaluates all the high risk clients, including PEPs, correspondent clients and MPS Fiduciaria customers.
