EMMI TO EXTEND THE PUBLICATION OF EURIBOR UNDER THE ACT/365
AND 30/360 COUNT BASIS UNTIL 31 MARCH 2019
        • Euribor calculated under the Act/365 and 30/360 day count
           conventions to be published on EMMI’s website until 31st March
           2019 and disseminated by the usual distribution vendors until 1st
           February 2019.
        • Discontinuation of the publication of panel banks’ submissions
           towards the determination of the Euribor benchmark and
           cessation of 2 weeks, 2 months and 9 months Euribor tenors to
           come in to force on 3rd December 2018.
28 November 2018, Brussels – Today, the European Money Markets
Institute (EMMI) announced that it will continue publishing Euribor
calculated under the Act/365 and 30/360 day count conventions on its
website until 31st March 2019. Additionally, the data dissemination by the
usual distribution vendors will be prolonged until 1st February 2019. Euribor
under its official Act/360 day count convention is not affected by the
decision and will continue to be published beyond this date.
EMMI had foreseen to withdraw the publication of the Act/365 and 30/360
count basis as of 3rd December 2018. However, following the requests of
several stakeholders, EMMI has taken the decision to continue with the
publication for four additional months. This should allow sufficient time for
all concerned parties to prepare their systems and contracts to
accommodate the change.
During the respective extension periods, users will be able to access the data
through the following sources:
   • From 3rd December 2018 until 31st March 2019, EMMI will publish the
       data on its website, in addition to Euribor calculated under the

       Act/360 convention, the rate under the Act/365 and 30/360 day
       counts. This publication will occur with a 24 hour delay.
    • From 3rd December 2018 until 1st February 2019, the data will
       continue to be disseminated by the usual distribution vendors. Users
       will be able to find Euribor under their preferred basis conversion in
       the respective screens. Starting 4th February 2019, the publication via
       the vendor screens will no longer be supported.
The cessation of the Euribor Act/365 and 30/360 day count conventions
tenors was proposed as part of the First Public Consultation on the Hybrid
Methodology, published on 26th March this year. EMMI found broad support
in its proposal to simplify the publication process by only calculating and
publishing Euribor on an Act/360 day count basis. In their feedback, most
stakeholders indicated that, given the simplicity of the calculation, they
could rely on internal tools to derive the discontinued calculations.
Two other measures agreed upon in the First Public Consultation on the
Hybrid Methodology will come in to force as of 3rd December:
    • Discontinuation of the publication of panel banks’ submissions:
       Individual panel banks’ submissions towards the determination of the
       Euribor benchmark will no longer be published. The majority of the
       respondents supported the discontinuation of the publication of
       panel banks’ individual contributions as these could reveal market-
       sensitive information. In turn, this could jeopardize a banks’ ability to
       raise funds in the marketplace, and ultimately deter financial
       institutions from participating in the daily determination of the index.
    • Cessation of 2 week, 2 month and 9 months Euribor tenors: In light
       of the broad support received for this proposal, EMMI will cease the
       calculation and publication of the 2 weeks, 2 months and 9 months
       Euribor tenors.
                                                                              Page 2

EMMI remains committed to informing all stakeholders about any future
updates relating to the hybrid methodology for Euribor.
