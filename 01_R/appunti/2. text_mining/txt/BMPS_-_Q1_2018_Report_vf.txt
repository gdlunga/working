1 Executive Summary
1.1 Summary
Organisation
To prepare this report based on the Q1 2018 results, the Monitoring Trustee team relied on:
 <U+F0A7> Information provided by BMPS in the form of a datapack (the “Monitoring Trustee Template”)
     and well as additional documents and files provided by BMPS
 <U+F0A7> Explanations provided by BMPS during due diligence meetings in Siena on 19 June 2018
 <U+F0A7> Explanations provided by MEF during a conference call on 20 December 2017.
Progress
As of Q1 2018, BMPS represents being compliant with behavioural Commitments: Acquisition ban
(#2), Coupon ban on existing instruments (#3), Dividend ban (#4), Advertising ban (#5), Sustainable
commercial policy and ban on aggressive pricing strategies (#6), Remuneration of the Bank's
Employees and Managers (#7), Liability Management Exercises (#8), Reduction of Italian sovereign
bonds in the AFS category (#21), Financial markets / proprietary trading limits (#22), appointment of
a Monitoring Trustee (#23). Additionally, the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (“MEF”)
represented on 16 July 2018 complying with the commitment of separate management of Italy's
stake in State owned banks (#20).
BMPS is progressing on the implementation of other Commitments of its restructuring plan,
including:
<U+F0A7> Burden sharing (#1): Conversion all AT1 and T2 instruments completed. Regarding the FRESH
    2008, BMPS has sent a letter to respective parties cancelling the usufruct agreement. In addition
    BMPS reclassified FRESH 2008 including it in CET1 as of 31/12/2017 and notified the ECB.
    However, investors in the FRESH 2008 are contesting before the Court of Luxembourg that the
    ineffectiveness of the contracts based on the art. 22 of decree 237 (burden sharing) applies to
    the underlying contract of FRESH.
<U+F0A7> Cost reduction measures (#9) : BMPS complies with # of branch, number of employee, C/I Ratio
    and costs targets for year end 2017
<U+F0A7> Balance Sheet targets (#10) : BMPS maintains a reduced balance sheet size of €136.8bn at
    31/03/2018 and is already below to the €145bn YE 2021 target
<U+F0A7> Disposal of participations and businesses (#14): BMPS sold its merchant acquiring business to
    Nexi Payments on 30/06/2017 for €536m
<U+F0A7> Risk Management and Credit Policy (#12): a few reporting tools are still in the process of being
    approved or populated on some specific points listed in the commitments: Commercial Policy
    pricing tables (12 c.iii), yearly report on independent control on portfolio valuation with file-by-
    file review (first release September 2018) (12d.ii).
<U+F0A7> Provisions related to connected borrowers (#13): BMPS has almost finalised the work planned on
    the reports and processes to monitor accurately the connected borrowers. The specific
    Connected Borrowers Policy has been approved by the Board on 10 May 2018. BMPS still needs
    to finalise the identification of relative persons and legal entities controlled by the Relevant
    Employees/Directors and Managers through a specific questionnaire to Relevant
    Employees/Directors and Managers (sent in May 2018).
<U+F0A7> Closure of foreign branches (#15): BMPS is on track on the action plan to close foreign branches
    by the end of 2018.
<U+F0A7> Disposal of NPLs (#16) : BMPS has completed the deconsolidation of the NPL SPV on 22/06/2018
    by selling junior tranches (before the 30/06/2018 deadline)
                                                                                                       5

                                                                                              6-Aug-18
<U+F0A7>    Disposal of non-core equity holdings (#18 ): BMPS sold to date its stakes in Consorzio Triveneto
     (€5m), Bassilichi (€12.9m) and Intermonte SIM (€20m)
<U+F0A7>    Strengthening of the Bank’s capital position (#24): BMPS issued on January 11, 2018 a
     subordinated Tier 2 bond of €750m. Given favorable rating obtained on the NPL SPV, the Senior
     A2 notes have not been created and the divestiture commitment became irrelevant, and
     considered completed
BMPS is in the early stage of the implementation of the following commitments, some of which
require a long preparation phase:
<U+F0A7> Disposal of real estate (#17): BMPS has finalised a City Plan and selected about 90 properties
     with a book value of about €650m to be disposed of. Collection of documentation will be
     finalized in Oct/Nov. 2018. Sales are expected to start in Q4 2018. BMPS has filed a request with
     Consob on a potential tender offer in 2018 on “Perimetro” senior notes to be able to unwind the
     structure. Consob gave its agreement subject to an adequate premium. BMPS expects to launch
     a tender offer in H2 2018 on “Perimetro” senior notes.
The MEF did not progress significantly yet in the implementation of the Sale of the State Participation
in BMPS (#11)
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the execution of the following Commitments will be challenging
for BMPS, OR that it requires special attention:
Burden Sharing (#1): BMPS has implemented on 10 August 2017 the conversion of all outstanding
Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and subordinated instruments, as identified in article 23 of Decree Law 23
December 2016, n. 237 converted by Law 17 February 2017, n. 15, has been implemented.
Regarding the FRESH 2008 instrument, BMPS explains it has taken the required steps to declare the
ineffectiveness of the agreement concerning own shares and believes that there is no any additional
motivation for holding a portion on the FRESH 2008 in AT1, and so has reclassified the full instrument
into CET1 and has notified it to the ECB at the end of 2017. More specifically, BMPS has sent (i) to
JPMorgan (arranger of the instrument and holder of the BMPS shares to be delivered in case of
conversion) a communication on the ineffectiveness of the usufruct and swap agreement, and (ii) to
JPMorgan and MUFJ (Luxembourg issuer of the Instrument) a communication on the capital
deficiency event. However, investors in the FRESH 2008 are contesting before the Court of
Luxembourg that the art. 22 of the decree 237 applies to the FRESH instrument. BMPS has therefore
filed a « Declaratory Request» before Italian courts to confirm that the Usufruct Agreement is indeed
targeted by the Decree 237. Should it be confirmed, it will file the result before the Court of
Luxembourg. BMPS indicates that should the “usufruct agreement” be invalidated but the “swap
agreement” remain in force, it may be forced to continue paying the remuneration in accordance
with the FRESH 2008 shares, which would happen if there is a distributable profit. The coupon on the
FRESH 2008 would then be the difference between the maximum dividend payable and the actual
dividend paid to ordinary shareholders, which could represent a substantial amount. The FRESH 2008
would need to be reclassified as Additional Tier 1 instead of CET1 (for €182m). BMPS understands
from its legal counsel that the litigations required to enforce burden sharing will last years and be
very costly. As of July 2018, the first hearing before the Italian courts is planned for December 2018,
and the BMPS has asked the Luxembourg jurisdiction to suspend its procedure waiting for the
outcome of the Italian procedure.
Cost reduction measures (#9): BMPS is implementing the cost reduction measures required under
the Restructuring Plan and BMPS targets to reach the 2018 net margin target of €1,354m thanks to a
recovery of commercial activities and volumes. However, BMPS already warns that it will be
challenging given:
                                                                                                      6

                                                                                               6-Aug-18
(i)       the low interest margin and the strong competition in the market driving revenues down,
(ii)      subdue commission income,
(iii)     the extra costs it will bear in 2018 to close and regroup branches,
(iv)      its inability to propose incentives to sale people which could boost revenues and
(v)       the certainty that the French subsidiary will not sold while the Belgian subsidiary could still
          be sold (and BMPS still needs to achieve the lowest cost target in 2018 while still having
          France on-board).
Should BMPS be required to reduce costs by an additional €100m in 2019, BMPS is studying
measures to reduce other costs such as: reduce workspace while selling real estate, merging MPS
Capital Services with Leasing & Factoring, improving work processes through digitalisation, and also
additional actions to reduce personnel costs (to advance deadline of early retirement program,
turnover of resources, etc) in order to avoid laying off younger employees.
BMPS also highlights that the recurring impact of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 (which will require to
deduct provisions on UTP and Past due loans directly for the interest income) will impact negatively
the reported net margin. BMPS plans to provide pro-forma P&L financials going forward to compare
with the Restructuring Plan under the same accounting rules of classification. Indeed BMPS explains
that it has only taken in account the impact of IFRS9 in the Restructuring Plan for the NPL disposals
and performing exposure, but did not take the P&L reclassification of LLP in the Net Interest Income
(netted).
Additionally, from Q1 2018, BMPS needs to reduce its number of branches to 1532 (vs 1597) by the
end of 2018 and states that it will be challenging given the workload necessary to on-board clients at
remaining branches.
Disposal of participations (#14): France: BMPS had received no binding offers by the 30/06/2018
deadline. It has started to develop a run-off scenario. They have mandated Olivier Wyman to map
out the process of such wind-down. The CFO has met Banque de France on 20 June 2018 to inform
them that they will enter in a wind-down process. Belgium: BMPS received one binding offer. To
explore fully the single binding offer received, BMPS asked a delay to the DG Comp to maintain the
normal activity of the subsidiary. This request was accepted by the DG Comp provided the
Monitoring Trustee is informed immediately of material evolutions.
Disposal of the art collection (#19): BMPS has about 11.000 artwork free of constraints with a book
value of only about €5.2m. Those pieces are considered unattractive in an auction, time consuming
to sell, and expensive to replace (furniture, graphics decorating walls). BMPS proposes to amend the
commitment and to sell 12 artworks attributed to Kandinskji (seized as collateral and currently under
authenticity assessment). However, EC DG Competition requires BMPS to proceed nevertheless with
the execution of the Commitment, and BMPS registers its intent to further discuss this point with EC
DG Competition.

                                                  Luxembourg courts
3.1.2    List of issues arising
Burden Sharing (#1): BMPS has implemented on 10 August 2017 the conversion of all outstanding
Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and subordinated instruments, as identified in article 23 of Decree Law 23
December 2016, n. 237 converted by Law 17 February 2017, n. 15, has been implemented.
Regarding the FRESH 2008 instrument, BMPS explains it has taken the required steps to declare the
ineffectiveness of the agreement concerning own shares and believes that there is no any additional
motivation for holding a portion on the FRESH 2008 in AT1, and so has reclassified the full instrument
into CET1 and has notified it to the ECB at the end of 2017. More specifically, BMPS has sent (i) to
JPMorgan (arranger of the instrument and holder of the BMPS shares to be delivered in case of
conversion) a communication on the ineffectiveness of the usufruct and swap agreement, and (ii) to
JPMorgan and MUFJ (Luxembourg issuer of the Instrument) a communication on the capital
deficiency event. However, investors in the FRESH 2008 are contesting before the Court of
Luxembourg that the art. 22 of the decree 237 applies to the FRESH instrument. BMPS has therefore
filed a « Declaratory Request» before Italian courts to confirm that the Usufruct Agreement is indeed
targeted by the Decree 237. Should it be confirmed, it will file the result before the Court of
Luxembourg. BMPS indicates that should the “usufruct agreement” be invalidated but the “swap
agreement” remain in force, it may be forced to continue paying the remuneration in accordance
with the FRESH 2008 shares, which would happen if there is a distributable profit. The coupon on the
FRESH 2008 would then be the difference between the maximum dividend payable and the actual
dividend paid to ordinary shareholders, which could represent a substantial amount. The FRESH 2008
would need to be reclassified as Additional Tier 1 instead of CET1 (for €182m). BMPS understands
from its legal counsel that the litigations required to enforce burden sharing will last years and be
very costly. As of July 2018, the first hearing before the Italian courts is planned for December 2018,
and the BMPS has asked the Luxembourg jurisdiction to suspend its procedure waiting for the
outcome of the Italian procedure.
3.1.3    Description of the commitment (A.1)
Italy shall implement the conversion of all outstanding Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 instruments as well as
any other subordinated instruments issued by the Bank, prior to the granting of State aid to the
Bank, as identified in article 23 of Decreto Legge 23 December 2016, n. 237 converted by Law 17
February 2017, n. 15.
                                                                                                     16

3.1.4             Description of the steps taken
As presented in the table below, the conversion of all outstanding Additional Tier 1, Tier 2
instruments as well as any other subordinated instruments issued by the Bank, prior to the granting
of State aid to the Bank, as identified in article 23 of Decreto Legge 23 December 2016, n. 237
converted by Law 17 February 2017, n. 15, has been implemented on 10 August 2017.
The mandatory conversion of outstanding subordinated bonds into shares under the burden sharing
principle with a nominal value as at December 31, 2016 has resulted in a common equity increase of
€4.283m, as shown in the table below (see column D) and described in the Restructuring Plan (see
Table 3.1.4.b.
         - To note that the Restructuring Plan 2016-21 (par. 6.1) assumed that subordinated bonds
                  owned by BMPS were null and there was no conversion into BMPS shares. However, the
                  implementation decrees issued by MEF in July 2017 provided that the subordinated bonds
                  owned by BMPS had to be converted into BMPS shares. Bonds held by MPS (€376m) become
                  36.3m of treasury shares post burden sharing. Consequently, the equity generation from
                  burden-sharing was of €4,283m instead of €4,473m if there had been not treasury shares.

     proceedings, the plaintiffs in question have divested their securities, selling their bonds before
     the entry into force of Decree Law 237/1 and the focus of the counterclaims is concentrated on
     the alleged lack of disclosure and/or violation of the applicable industry regulation (CFA 58/98
     and implementing regulations) in the same way as any other “similar” financial proceeding
     brought against BMPS. The plaintiffs dispute the misselling or marketing of the securities in
     violation of the provisions of Legislative Decree 58/98 (and implementing regulations), as well as
     the general principles of fairness, transparency and diligence.
Focus on FRESH 2008
As mentioned in the Restructuring Plan BMPS had foreseen a positive effect deriving from the
application of Art. 22 para. 4 of Decree 237/2016 to certain provisions of the FRESH 2008 transaction
(such as the usufruct) that should have led to an increase in CET1 of €182m.
In the meantime, BMPS has sent (i) to JPMorgan (arranger of the instrument and holder of the BMPS
shares to be delivered in case of conversion) a communication on the ineffectiveness of the usufruct
and swap agreement, and (ii) to JPMorgan and MUFJ (Luxembourg issuer of the Instrument) a
communication on the capital deficiency event. However, investors in the FRESH 2008 are contesting
before the Court of Luxembourg that the burden sharing decree 237 applies to the FRESH
instrument. BMPS has therefore filed a « Declaratory Request» before Italian courts to confirm that
the Usufruct Agreement is indeed targeted by the Decree 237. At the end of December, BMPS,
considering that it has done its utmost, have reclassified the Fresh 2008 shares in CET1. The
reclassification of the FRESH shares as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments was notified to the ECB but
it was not subject to any approval by the Supervisory Authority which has not the power to formally
authorize such reclassification. However, it is worth highlighting that the Joint Supervisory Team
informally confirmed to BMPS that the ECB will not object to the reclassification of the FRESH shares
as Common Equity Tier 1.
Background on FRESH 2008
Nature of the FRESH 2008
FRESH 2008 are to “Floating Rate Equity-linked Subordinated Hybrid Preferred Securities” issued on
April 16, 2008 and convertible into ordinary shares of BMPS.
In April 2008, in order to finance its acquisition of Banca Antonveneta, the BMPS undertook a Rights
Offering by which it increased its ordinary share capital for a total value of €950 million, which were
subscribed for by J.P. Morgan. As part of the transaction, J.P. Morgan granted the BMPS usufruct
rights on the shares for a term of 30 years. As consideration for the usufruct rights, BMPS agreed to
pay an annual fee, provided BMPS has distributable net income and pays dividends in cash during the
relevant years.
As long as the usufruct is in force, the voting rights relative to the FRESH 2008 Shares are suspended
and dividend rights are not ascribable to them, and subscription rights are assigned to JP Morgan,
which will be required to transfer them to The Bank of New York (Luxembourg) for their subsequent
on-transfer to the holders of the FRESH 2008 securities pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
same securities.
In turn, BMPS and J.P. Morgan entered into a swap agreement with a term equal to BMPS’s
corporate existence (currently December 31, 2100 under its Articles of Association), and according to
which: (a) J.P. Morgan undertook to pay BMPS, at the time of conversion of the FRESH 2008
securities, €50 million (equal to the difference between the nominal value of the FRESH 2008 Shares
of €1 billion and that of the related rights offering, €950 million; and (b) BMPS undertook to pay J.P.
                                                                                                     18

Morgan, on an annual basis, payments equal to the product of the average market value (measured
in the year prior to the payment) of 295,236,070 BMPS shares and a rate (determined as the greater
of 95 basis points (0.95%) and the value of the senior five-year credit default swap subscribed by J.P.
Morgan) measured in the quarter prior to the payment.

Treatment of the FRESH 2008
The €950m capital increase underlying the Fresh 2008 was initially recognized in equity as follows:
     <U+F0A7> Share capital:                         €198m
     <U+F0A7> Share premium:                         €752m
Due to the introduction of the New Euro
pean Directive (CRD 2.5), on 1/2/12 the due to the capital increase without consideration, the
amount of €752m has been transferred from share premium account to share capital account.
     <U+F0A7> Share capital:                         €950m
Following a free share capital increase of €750m approved in 2012 applicable to the share premium
reserve, the portion of the FRESH related 2008 €950m reserved capital increase that has Additional
Tier 1 (AT1) characteristics as at 31 December 2015 amounts to €182m.
A portion of the consideration (€76m) has been subsequently accounted and treated as a liability
following the Consob’s and Bank of Italy’s decision. Therefore the capital increase underlying Fresh
2008 is currently accounted as share capital for €874m.
Finally, an amount of €16m representing the initial arrangement fee should be deducted from the
total amount.
The accounting treatment of the FRESH 2008 is therefore now the following:
     <U+F0A7> CET1:                      € 692 m (=950-76-198-16)
     <U+F0A7> AT1:                       € 182 m
     <U+F0A7> Due to banks: € 76 m
Implementation of the Decision
As required by the Decision, BMPS has sent in October and November 2017:
     (i)         to JPMorgan (arranger of the instrument and holder of the BMPS shares to be delivered
                 in case of conversion) communications on the ineffectiveness of the usufruct and swap
                 agreement, and
     (ii)        to JPMorgan and MUFJ (Luxembourg issuer of the Instrument) communications on the
                 capital deficiency event.
                                                                                                            19

Lawsuit
A group of investors have filed a lawsuit in Luxembourg after BMPS announced bonds would be
annulled as part of a state-backed recapitalisation. The bondholders are also suing MUFJ, as issuer of
the bond, and JPMorgan, which arranged the issuance. The bondholder representative said they had
filed a declaratory action with the competent Luxembourg court against BMPS and other parties
involved to determine that such unilateral declarations by BMPS have no legal basis and that the
contracts relating to the FRESH 2008 bonds should remain valid. The unnamed bondholders,
represented by Anthony Braesch from law firm Bouchoms and Braesch, argue that the legal basis for
the decision to invalidate the bonds was “insufficient, arbitrary and in breach of fundamental EU
laws. In the event the bonds do not remain valid, the lawsuit demands €1bn in damages.
                                                                                                   20

                  a. The FITD VS contributed for €470m to the recapitalisation of three distressed
                      Italian banks (i.e. Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini and

                                        b. As the FITD VS available funds were insufficient, it had to raise an extra €95m in

                                              from selling three banks to Cariparma) = €340m divided by €640m = 53.1%)
                                              would corresponds to an amount of €5.7m * 53.1% = ca. €3.02m

The Bank shall refrain from making any payments on capital instruments in existence at the Effective
Date, unless those payments stem from a legal obligation, and shall not call or buy back those
instruments without prior approval of the Commission. Coupons on capital instruments held by the
State may be paid, unless such payments would trigger coupon payments to other investors that
otherwise would not be mandatory. This commitment of non-payment of coupons during the
restructuring period does not apply to newly issued instruments (i.e. instruments issued after the
Effective Date), in particular the Tier 2 subordinated bond to be issued in 2018 as detailed in the
Decision. In case of doubt as to whether, for the purpose of the present Commitment, a legal
obligation exists, the Bank shall submit the proposed coupon or dividend payment to the
Commission for approval.

The Bank shall not pay dividends. The payment of a dividend in kind is not covered by the present
commitment. The Bank may pay dividends when both CET1 and Total Capital ratios exceed the
relevant SREP guidance periodically provided by ECB by at least 100 basis points.
3.4.4       Description of the steps taken
No dividend has been paid from the effective date (04.07.2017) up to now.
According to BMPS forecast, the bank may pay dividends on the 2018 and 2019 results as BMPS CET1
and Total Capital ratios would be more than 100 bps above the SREP threshold (which can be revised
yearly). Nevertheless, BMPS has not forecasted any dividend payment for the duration of the plan.

3.7.2    List of issues arising
No issue to report to date.
See BMPS comments in section 4.1.
3.7.3    Description of the commitment (A.7)
The Bank shall apply strict executive remuneration policies. The total remuneration of any individual
may not exceed 10 times the average salary of the employees of the Bank in 2016.
3.7.4    Description of the steps taken
Salary
The salary cap on total remuneration to any board member, manager and employee was
implemented from the Effective Date by the Bank in line with the commitment. All managers
accepted to have their salary reduced to a maximum of 10 times the average salary of the employees
of the Bank in 2016. Methodology used for the average salary calculation (€46,625) was checked by
the auditor.
BMPS implemented two necessary checks in order to assure compliance with the commitments, at
Group level:
     <U+F0A7> First level checks: Payroll function verifies monthly the alignment between the commitment
         and the amounts to be paid;
     <U+F0A7> Second level checks: Compensation function verifies monthly the alignment between the
         commitment and the amounts paid.
Before the commitment and connected actions implemented, 8 managers and the chairman of the
BoD received a total remuneration greater than ten times the average salary (€466,250). In order to
implement the salary cap, their total remuneration has been reduced. The starting date of the cap is
4th July 2017.
As of 31/03/2018, the maximum remuneration was €466,250, 10x the 2016 average salary.
Benefits
BMPS also stated that the maximum estimated amount of benefits granted to the top 8 managers (in
term of remuneration) of € 47,391 is below 10x the average benefit for all personnel at 31/12/2016
(€49,610).
     <U+F0A7> The average of benefits equivalents (that includes TFR, FPC, Lunching vouchers, Health
         insurance, Long Term Care insurance and Permanent disability / life insurance) was
         calculated on the basis of the total number of employees.

3.8.3                 Description of the commitment (A.8)
The Bank shall not undertake any Liability Management Exercise (including calls) unless it is
implemented at conditions by which it occurs at a double digit discount in percentage points from
nominal value and at no more than 10% above the market price. Any Liability Management Exercise
(including debt to equity swaps and equity to debt swaps) will be timely submitted to the
Commission services for approval. This commitment does not apply to transactions already included
in the Restructuring Plan. Furthermore, this commitment does not apply to the cancellation prior to
maturity of any bonds owned by the Bank as at the date of the Decision and not subsequently sold to
third parties.
3.8.4                 Description of the steps taken
Since July 2017, no Liability Management Exercise (including calls) was undertaken.
Market conditions have not been favourable to date to envisage a Liability management exercise
within the allowed limits.
            <U+F0A7> BMPS states that except for the equity to senior swap offer targeting one issuance addressed
                      to retail customers and subject to misseling, no burden-sharing related settlement was
                      offered by the Bank.

                                                    workloads
3.9.2    List of issues arising
Cost reduction measures (#9): BMPS is implementing the cost reduction measures required under
the Restructuring Plan and BMPS targets to reach the 2018 net margin target of €1,354m thanks to a
recovery of commercial activities and volumes. However, BMPS already warns that it will be
challenging given:
(vi)     the low interest margin and the strong competition in the market driving revenues down,
(vii)    subdue commission income,
(viii)   the extra costs it will bear in 2018 to close and regroup branches,
(ix)     its inability to propose incentives to sale people which could boost revenues and
(x)      the certainty that the French subsidiary will not sold while the Belgian subsidiary could still
         be sold (and BMPS still needs to achieve the lowest cost target in 2018 while still having
         France on-board).
Should BMPS be required to reduce costs by an additional €100m in 2019, BMPS is studying
measures to reduce other costs such as: reduce workspace while selling real estate, merging MPS
Capital Services with Leasing & Factoring, improving work processes through digitalisation, and also
additional actions to reduce personnel costs (to advance deadline of early retirement program,
turnover of resources, etc) in order to avoid laying off younger employees.
BMPS also highlights that the recurring impact of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 (which will require to
deduct provisions on UTP and Past due loans directly for the interest income) will impact negatively
the reported net margin. BMPS plans to provide pro-forma P&L financials going forward to compare
with the Restructuring Plan under the same accounting rules of classification. Indeed BMPS explains
that it has only taken in account the impact of IFRS9 in the Restructuring Plan for the NPL disposals
and performing exposure, but did not take the P&L reclassification of LLP in the Net Interest Income
(netted).
Additionally, from Q1 2018, BMPS needs to reduce its number of branches to 1532 (vs 1597) by the
end of 2018 and states that it will be challenging given the workload necessary to on-board clients at
remaining branches.

reduction shall be achieved through a cut of Total Operating Costs (Personnel Expenses, Other
Administrative Expenses, Amortization and Depreciation), compared to the target referred in the
Restructuring Plan (Base Case) submitted to the Commission, for all the years following that in which
the Net Margin is not achieved. All the legal instruments needed to achieve the cost reduction should
be used, including re-negotiation and rescission of contracts with third parties and stakeholders, if
needed.
Compliance with the projected operational result will be assessed by the Monitoring Trustee at the
moment of the approval of the end of the year results by the Board of Directors (in principle in the
course of March). A detailed plan to implement any additional cost reductions will be submitted to
the Commission within two months from the approval of the end of the year financial results by the
Board of Directors. Within two weeks from its submission, the Commission will either accept the cost

  The number of employees in any year does not include any employees of MPS who were outsourced by MPS
in 2013 in the Fruendo transaction and who MPS is/has been required to reinstate as employees of MPS as a
result of ongoing labour litigations.

  The costs in any year do not include any extraordinary non-cash item deriving from the positive accrual of the
servicing fee which is incurred following MPS being required to reinstate certain employees of MPS as a result
of ongoing labour litigations.

reduction plan or will send its observation, indicating the modification upon which the acceptance is
conditional. Within four weeks from receiving the Commission's observations, an amended cost
reduction plan will be submitted to the Commission.
The actions included in the cost cutting plan shall determine an annualized outcome in line with the
adjustment required and will be fully implemented within 12 months from the approval of the plan,
with the aim to produce pro rata accountable results already at the end of year t+1 (being t the year
in which the breach is realized). Accounting wise, full cost cutting outcomes shall be fully measurable
in t+2 full year results.
The Bank will therefore be required to reach new Total Cost targets in year t+1 and t+2 in accordance
with what agreed upon in the plan for additional cost cutting accepted by the Commission. Should
for example the breach happen in 2019 and be equal to the maximum amount of EUR 100m, the new
Total Operating Costs target for year end 2021 would be equal to EUR 2,060m (EUR 2,160 – EUR
100m), whereas an intermediate target shall be set for year-end 2020.
If the Net Margin targets in a given year are not achieved due to force majeure contingencies outside
the bank's control (war, terrorism, natural disasters, significant crisis or uncertainty in the Italian
financial system and markets, impacting liquidity or access to funding for Italian financial institutions
generally, resulting from national or international monetary, political, financial or economic
conditions or securities markets or in currency exchange rates or interest rates, where the average
Italian BTP/German Bund spread is above 400 bps for at least 3 months), Italy shall present to the
Commission a proposal containing a justification and remedy measures.
For the purpose of Commitment 9, in the case the Foreign Banks (Monte Paschi France, Banca Monte
Paschi Belgio) should not be divested by 30 June 2018 and paragraph b) of Commitment 14 should
apply (“Run Off”), all the reference figures and tables in Commitment 9 should be substituted, at all
effects, with figures and tables in Annex to Commitment 9, incorporating figures from the Run Off, as
stated in the “Restructuring Plan B – Foreign Banks Run Off” submitted to the Commission.

a) Number of branches in Italy

                                     2017      2017     Q1 2018     2018     2019      2020      2021
 Number of branches in Italy         1,745     1,862      1,597     1,532    1,432     1,432     1,432
The number of branches continues to decrease vs. December 2017 and it is close to the 2018 target.
The Bank has already made three rounds of closures for a total of 435 branches closed between
January 2017 and January 2018 (287 branches closed in 2017 and 148 in January 2018 <U+21D2> c. 73% of
the 2021 target) with, until now, a limited attrition rate (c.3% of total funding related to the
November2017/January 2018 branch closures).
From Q1 2018, BMPS needs to reduce its number of branches to 1532 (vs 1597) by the end of 2018
and states that it will be challenging given the workload necessary to on-board clients at remaining
branches.
b) Number of employees

The number of employees in the Bank at 31/03/2018 equals 23.423: headcount reduction of 1.800
employees already completed by means of the Solidarity Fund (of which 1.200 on 1st November
2017) (ca. 39% of the 2021 target). An additional early retirement plan in 2018 will allow to reach
the target by year end.
c) Total operating costs and cost-to-income ratio

In Q1 2018 the total operating costs annualised (2.292€/mln) were in line with target 2018 (vs 2.410
€/mln).
Operating costs down (-11.9%) vs. Q4 2017:
      - Personnel expenses benefitting from the 1.200 exits carried out in November 2017 (total
            annual cost savings of EUR 135mln for the 1.800 exits in 2017 of which only c. EUR 45mln
            included in 2017 accounts)
      - Other admin expenses down vs. Q4 2017, which was impacted by seasonality
      - Depreciation and amortisation down Q/Q mainly due to less write-downs of intangible assets
d) Additional cost cutting
BMPS still targets to reach the Net Margin target of year end 2018 and therefore avoid implementing
additional cost cutting measures to date.

Focus on IFRS 9 Application
In the Restructuring Plan, BMPS have not considered any reclassification between Net Interest
Income and LLP (neither for bad loans nor for the other impaired loans).
                                                                                                                       36

                                                                                                6-Aug-18
IFRS 9, differently from IAS39, provides that NII of impaired loans should be calculated on net
exposures. It also envisages that the effect of bad loans reversal time value is recorded in NII.

    a) The Bank shall bring its balance sheet below EUR 145 billion by the end of the restructuring
         period.
    b) The net loans to deposit ratio (calculated on the basis of balance sheet item 70 of assets and
         items 20, 30 and 50 of liabilities) shall not exceed the following:
                             31/12/2017 31/12/2018 31/12/2019 31/12/2020 31/12/2021

The growth rate of the gross loans shall not be higher than the growth rate of the market as provided
in the projections on which the restructuring plan is based. However, if the Bank succeeds in
recovering more than expected direct funding, the Bank may grow above market average provided
that it matches its loans / deposit ratio target.
For the purpose of Commitment 10, in the case the Foreign Banks (Monte Paschi France, Banca
Monte Paschi Belgio) should not be divested by 30 June 2018 and paragraph b) of Commitment 14
should apply (“Run Off”), all the reference figures and tables in Commitment 10 should be

relevant contacts at MEF Direzione VII to follow up on the Commitment, which was contacted but did
not reply to date. BMPS has provided a new contact at the MEF - Direzione VII (dr. di Stefano) that
the Monitoring Trustee contacted in June 2018.
As of today, all option remain open and the MEF didn’t formalized any specific routes. It declares that
a program with milestone will be provided by the end of 2019. Any extraordinary operation
submitted by the Board of Directors of BMPS (e.g. merger operation) will be considered by the MEF
in light of the exit strategy. The MEF also specify that the selling plan will be implemented in
compliance with the privatization's Italian Law (Law 474/1994) and the sale process will be open,
unconditional and non-discriminatory.

and Credit                                          and control requirements
Policies
3.12.2 List of issues arising
Risk Management and Credit Policy (#12): Risk Management and Credit Policy (#12): a few reporting
tools are still in the process of being approved or populated on some specific points listed in the
commitments: Commercial Policy pricing tables (12 c.iii), yearly report on independent control on
portfolio valuation with file-by-file review (first release September 2018) (12d.ii).
3.12.3 Description of the commitment (A.12)
The Credit Policy shall specify that all customers shall be treated fairly through non-discriminatory
procedures other than those related to credit risk and ability to pay. The Credit Policy defines the
thresholds above which the granting of loans must be approved by higher levels of management.
Similar thresholds shall be defined regarding
    a) the restructuring of loans and the handling of claims and litigations. The Credit Policy are
         defined centrally at national level, and provide clear safeguards to ensure a consistent
         implementation of its instructions within the Bank.
    b) The Bank shall fully incorporate the Credit Policy rules in their loan origination and loan
         refinancing workflow and disbursement systems.
    c) The Commercial Policy shall require that the pricing of loans and mortgages to comply with
         strict guidelines. Those guidelines shall include the obligation to respect strictly the credit
         policy's standard tables of interest rate bands (ranges) depending on the maturity of the
         loan, the credit risk assessment of the customer, the expected recoverability of pledged
         collateral (including the time frame to a potential liquidation), the overall relationship with
         the Bank (e.g. level and stability of deposits, fee structure and other cross-sales activities)
         and the funding cost of the Bank. Specific loan asset classes are generated (e.g. commercial
         loan, mortgage, secured/unsecured, etc.) and their pricing framework is tabulated to an
         appropriate Commercial Policy table that shall be updated on a regular basis by the
         Commercial Committee. Any exception must be duly authorized by the Commercial
         Committee, or at lower level of authority when allowed by the Commercial Policy. Tailor-
         made transactions such as syndicated loans or project finance shall respect the same
         principles, with due account being taken of the fact that they may not fit in standardized
         commercial policy tables. The same reports produced for the Commercial Committee will be
         available to the Monitoring Trustee.
    d) The Risk Management Department shall be responsible for the monitoring of credit risk
         (based on independent credit risk assessment, i.e. internal rating system) and for the
         independent controls on portfolio valuation. When assessing the portfolio quality, the Risk
         Management Department shall provide a monthly report on credit risk and activate the
         proper escalation mechanism in case thresholds on credit quality are breached. Regarding
         the independent controls on portfolio valuation, the Risk Management Department shall
         provide a yearly written report, with a file-by-file review on the basis of a predefined sample.
                                                                                                       41

                                                                                                        6-Aug-18
      e) Granting loans3 to enable borrowers to purchase shares or instruments counting towards
           own funds of the Bank shall be prohibited, whoever those borrowers4 are. This commitment
           applies to all subsidiaries of the Bank, either domestic or foreign.
      f) The Credit Policy shall give clear instructions on the restructuring of loans. It clearly defines
           which loans are eligible, under which circumstances, and indicates the terms and conditions
           that can be proposed to eligible customers. The Bank shall ensure that all restructurings aim
           at enhancing its future recoveries, thus safeguarding the interest of the Bank. In no case the
           restructuring policy shall jeopardize the future profitability of the Bank, and any restructuring
           proposal should contain an outline of the rationale behind it. For that purpose, the Bank's
           Risk Management Department shall be responsible for developing and deploying adequate
           restructuring effectiveness reporting mechanisms, mainly based on sample controls
           reporting its findings at least on a quarterly basis to the Credit Committee and the Board Risk
           Committee, suggesting actionable improvements to the processes and policies involved and
           oversee and reporting on their implementation to the Credit Committee and the Board Risk
           Committee.
      g) The Bank shall enact a claim and litigation policy aiming at maximizing recovery net of the
           cost for potential legal procedure and preventing any discrimination or preferential
           treatment in the management of litigations. The Bank shall ensure that all necessary actions
           are taken to maximize the recoveries for the Bank and protect its financial position in the
           long-term.
      h) The Bank shall monitor credit risk through a well-developed set of alerts and reports, which
           enable the Risk Management Department to: (i) identify early signals of loan impairment and
           default events, through an independent analysis of the watch-list; (ii) assess recoverability of
           the loan portfolio (including but not limited to alternative repayment sources such as co-
           debtors and guarantors as well as collateral pledged or available but not pledged), through a
           coverage analysis; (iii) assess the overall exposure of the Bank to an individual customer or
           on a portfolio basis, monitoring the actual implementation of “Politiche Creditizie”; and (iv)
           propose corrective and improvement actions to the Board of Directors, based on explicit RAS
           Appetite and Tolerance levels defined by the Board itself, or to the appropriate escalation
           level accordingly to the Limit system defined by the CEO. The Monitoring Trustee shall be
           given access to that information.
      i) The Bank shall manage the existing commercial assets in a way that maximises Net Present
           Value (NPV) of the assets in accordance with normal commercial practice and fiduciary
           duties. Specifically, if a client cannot respect the terms of his loan, the Bank shall only
           restructure the lending terms (deferral or partial waiver of repayments, conversion of (part
           of) the claim in capital, etc.) if such a restructuring leads to enhancing the present value of
           the loan (i.e. if the present value of the cash flows to be expected from the restructuring is
           higher than the present value of the cash flows which can be expected from liquidation). In
           exceptional and duly justified circumstances, judgmental elements relevant for the decision
           but not included in the NPV calculation should be properly documented and assessed.
      j) As regards the Bank's mortgage assets, the obligations that apply to the commercial assets
           shall apply mutatis mutandis. The Bank, in particular, shall be allowed to restructure its
           mortgage assets via the following variations to the terms of existing mortgages i) a change of
           deal (e.g. by offering a new fixed rate); ii) transferring existing mortgages to new properties;
           and iii) transferring equity (e.g. adding a borrower to the mortgage or removing one. In
           exceptional and duly justified circumstances, judgmental elements relevant for the decision
           but not included in the NPV calculation should be properly documented and assessed.
3
  For the purpose of that Commitment, the term "loans" shall be interpreted as any kind of financing, e.g. credit
facility, guarantee, etc.
4
  For clarification, all borrowers, including the Bank's private banking clients are covered by that Commitment.
                                                                                                              42

                                                                                                6-Aug-18
    k) The bank shall price deposit contracted or renewed after the effective date (sight deposit,
         time deposit and certificates of deposit) as to align by 2021 the deposits rate to that of the
         banking system with a tolerance margin of 5bps. In each year of the Restructuring Plan the
         Bank shall reduce its cost of deposits spread compared to that of the Italian banking system
         (28 bps at 31/03/2017 based on ABI data), and it shall target a spread of 15 bps at end 2019
         and of 10 bps at end 2020.
         The bank shall not price credit or other loan business granted after the effective date below
         the market average of products with the same characteristic.
3.12.4 Description of the steps taken
For the Monitoring of the current Commitment #12, the Monitoring Trustee conducted interviews
with BMPS Chief Risk Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Commercial Officer’s senior manager and
their team, based on a document prepared by BMPS presenting where evidence of the
implementation of the commitments could be found. When relevant, tables and statements were
also included in the documents. BMPS also sent the actual support documentation where the policies
and guidelines where written. The Monitoring Trustee made a sample review of the consistence of
the BMPS statements and the policies. However, some policies and guidelines are in the process of
being implemented and BMPS owns more information in the next report. The following analysis
presents how BMPS represents complying with each sentences of the commitment and/or the next
steps required.
Progress status:
      = Not initiated           = Initiated       = well progressed and requiring periodic updates
      = Completed               = Breach
         a.i. “The Credit Policy shall specify that all customers shall be treated fairly through non-
         discriminatory procedures other than those related to credit risk and ability to pay.”
         BMPS states that: the credit policies are described in the following regulatory documents issued by
         the Parent Company:
               - D1366 – Credit Policy Guidelines (15/06/2017);
               - D2054 – Rules on the granting of credit (updated on 29/06/2017);
               - D1991 – Group Loan Classification/Provisioning Policy (10/02/2017);
               - D2094 – Rules on the granting of a moratorium (30/03/2016);
               - D2226 – General Credit Monitoring Guidance.
         BMPS explained that “the policies have been structured to provide fair treatment for transactions
         and customers with similar characteristics”, although “this is not expressly stated in any policy”.
         BMPS added that “the companies of the Group, in turn, issue similar policies in compliance with the
         guidelines and processes described below, adapting internal rules, responsibilities and processes
         according to their own specific characteristics and sizes”.
         a.ii. “The Credit Policy defines the thresholds above which the granting of loans must be approved
         by higher levels of management. Similar thresholds shall be defined regarding the restructuring of
         loans and the handling of claims and litigations. The Credit Policy are defined centrally at national
         level, and provide clear safeguards to ensure a consistent implementation of its instructions within
         the Bank.”
         BMPS states that: where possible, policies are embedded within the loan disbursement and
         monitoring procedure. Nonetheless, the procedures also establish that in exceptional circumstances
         where requests for waivers are made, the credit units – according to their chain of authority – must
                                                                                                      43

                                                                                     6-Aug-18
provide appropriate reasons to support their decisions. Such decisions are always taken by the
credit units.
Decision-making powers for the management of loans are set by the Parent Company in Regulation
no. 48 – Decision-making powers regarding Credit (D976 of 23/06/2017), and is the only source of
reference, with the exception of the Regulations on the «Decision-making powers regarding claims
and litigations (D1725 of 23/06/2017). The subsidiaries must establish their own decision-making
system based on drivers provided by the Parent Company.
BMPS implemented a rating brands to differentiate the autonomies. The principle on which the
deliberative autonomies are based, established in accordance with the Basel 2 metrics, provides for
a graduation of competences according to:
    (i) the rating given to each counterparty;
    (ii) the amount of concessions;
    (iii) the collateral;
    (iv) the nature of the client.
The deliberative competences are established through a methodology which requires the increase
of the amounts in the presence of better ratings and a reduction in the presence of worse ratings
(merged on 7 bands). The autonomy delegations, are approved by the Board of Directors and are
conferred in descending order down to the branch manager.
Table 3.12.5.a.a. – Credit Policy: BMPS Deliberative chain as at Q1 2018
The deliberation limits of the Credit approval process are defined taking into account both the rating
and the amount of the loan required by the client. A summary presentation can be found in the
table below and the monitoring trustee received the detailed table by product and function.
Table 3.12.5.a.c. – Credit Policy: Deliberation limits
                                                                                            44

                                                                                       6-Aug-18
Internal Rating is subject to a specific approval (CRO) procedure which is segregated from the credit
approval process.
The autonomy for the definition of the “Rating Ufficiale Interno” (Official Internal rating) is based on
the override faculty that can be exercised only in case of availability of additional information that
cannot be taken into account by the Rating System and is measured in terms of upgrade or
downgrade on one of the Statistical Rating defined by the Rating System.
b. “The Bank shall fully incorporate the Credit Policy rules in their loan origination and loan
refinancing workflow and disbursement systems.”
BMPS states that: in 2017 the Parent Company issued specific documents governing the loan
origination and refinancing process with the aim of ensuring the application of the rules laid down in
the Policy and achieving a more efficient and effective loan management process.
The documents are as follows:
     - Rules on the granting and revision of credit (D2054 del 29/06/2017): The document details
         the rules for the origination and disbursement of credit, particularly with reference to the
         stages managed through the Electronic Credit Line Procedure (known as PEF). The loan
         origination and disbursement process is developed within the Loans and Guarantees Service
         unit and is distinguished between the stages managed with PEF (the vast majority) and the
         external phases managed by transactions within the Operational Information System or
         parallel to the business procedures.
     - The granting and revision of credit (D1591 of 20/06/2017) which governs the disbursement
         process;
     - Rules on the granting of a moratorium D2094 of 30/0372016) which governs the refinancing
         process
The bank’s processes are fully automated and aligned with policies/process documents and the
Group is making further investments with a view to progressive maintenance aimed at boosting
efficiency and effectiveness.
In addition the Group has planned a series of measures to keep aligned the new accounting
framework with operational processes. Specifically:
     - A new credit-granting procedure (PEF) is currently being developed with progressive rollout
         as of the end of 2018;
     - Rollout of the new amortizing loan management procedure has begun.
The two tools will allow any changes to the loan origination policy to be more promptly
incorporated. In 2017, a progressive maintenance process was initiated on scoring engines used in

                                                                                               45

                                                                                       6-Aug-18
BMPS has automated the systems and considers being compliant with the commitment. The
Monitoring Trustee shall be updated with a precise timetable on the new tools expected YE 2018/Q1
2019 for SMEs and YE 2019 for retail clients.
c.i. ”The Commercial Policy shall require that the pricing of loans and mortgages to comply with
strict guidelines.”
BMPS states that: On March 2018, BMPS explained that the Group’s new Pricing Policy has been
drawn up in recent months. The Policy governs the pricing guidelines in their various forms. The
pricing strategies follow a value-oriented logic and are aimed at creating, maximising and
maintaining value on the customer across the entire life cycle of the products themselves (launch,
development, maturity, decline).
The document was approved by the BoD on April 17th 2018.
The Monitoring Trustee received the final policy approved by the BoD.
c.ii. “Those guidelines shall include the obligation to respect strictly the credit policy's standard
tables of interest rate bands (ranges) depending on the maturity of the loan, the credit risk
assessment of the customer, the expected recoverability of pledged collateral (including the time
frame to a potential liquidation), the overall relationship with the Bank (e.g. level and stability of
deposits, fee structure and other cross-sales activities) and the funding cost of the Bank.”
BMPS states that: The pricing laid down in the policy takes account of several factors, including:
      - Annual budget targets;
      - Costs sustained by the Bank for the development and management of individual products
          and provision of related services;
      - Balance between profitability targets and competitive positioning on the market;
      - Risk and value generated by the relationship with the customer.
The current policies on the Product Development, Purchasing and Management process
(1030D01817) already contains the guidelines, where practicable, on the use of tools to determine
the industrial cost of the products.
The Monitoring Trustee received the guidelines 1817.
c.iii. “Specific loan asset classes are generated (e.g. commercial loan, mortgage, secured/unsecured,
etc.) and their pricing framework is tabulated to an appropriate Commercial Policy table that shall
be updated on a regular basis by the Commercial Committee.”
BMPS states that: On December 2017, BMPS explained that in the coming months (1Q 2018) the
group will proceed with:
      - Formalising the rules, criteria, metrics and reference tables in a new methodological
          document whose contents will need to be approved by the Commercial Committee upon
          the proposal of the Product Functions (Approval expected within 2018)
      - Establish a specific new session of the Investments and Products Committee, to which the
          following tasks will be assigned:
               o Approval of pricing framework for loan products/subsequent amendments;
               o Analysis of report on pricing trends (approval expected within May 2018).
BMPS indicated that they will identify existing committees that will act as the “Commercial
Committee” as not such committee was existent at the date of the Decision.
The Monitoring Trustee will be presented with pricing tables and reports on pricing trends with the
Q2 2018 report which should serve as a tool for the implementation of the Commitment.
                                                                                             46

                                                                                      6-Aug-18
c.iv. “Any exception must be duly authorized by the Commercial Committee, or at lower level of
authority when allowed by the Commercial Policy.”
BMPS states that: Regulation no. 3 (rif. 1030D00752) governs the decision-making powers allocated
to first-line management (CCO, Head of Retail l, WM and Corporate) regarding:
     - Products (approval of new products or amendments to existing products, including product
          pricing and delisting);
     - Waiver on individual position or unit (bilateral amendment to one or more of the terms
          previously agreed on).
The Monitoring Trustee received the document 752.
c.v. “Tailor-made transactions such as syndicated loans or project finance shall respect the same
principles, with due account being taken of the fact that they may not fit in standardized commercial
policy tables.”
BMPS states that: Group’s Products Directive not only regulates the "standard” products, i.e. those
for the Products Catalogue, but also the so-called "ad hoc products”, i.e. those products required by
specific clients or client groups identified by name ex-ante. The decision-making powers for ad hoc
products are not differentiated from those for standard products. This also applies to product
implementation requirements.
c.vi. “The same reports produced for the Commercial Committee will be available to the Monitoring
Trustee.”
BMPS states that: On December 2017, BMPS “will proceed as per the requirements of the
Commitment. Any actions which may be requested by the Commercial Committee in relation to
what is currently produced will also be notified to the Trustee”.
BMPS presented reports produced for the Commercial Committee to the Monitoring Trustee

The Monitoring Trustee shall review regularly samples of reports to be provided by BMPS.
d.i. “The Risk Management Department shall be responsible for the monitoring of credit risk (based
on independent credit risk assessment, i.e. internal rating system) and for the independent controls
on portfolio valuation. When assessing the portfolio quality, the Risk Management Department shall
provide a monthly report on credit risk and activate the proper escalation mechanism in case
thresholds on credit quality are breached.”
BMPS states that: BMPS has already in place:
      - Monthly credit risk report;
      - Results from the monthly monitoring of Credit Risk Limits (reporting to CGR);
BMPS provided to the Monitoring Trustee a sample report as of 31 December 2017 with the details
on the following topics:
      - Regulatory RWA and Internal RWA
      - Loan Portfolio and AIRB
      - Cost of credit
      - Migration and flow matrix, AIRB for both corporates and retail portfolio
      - Operational limits and overruns by divisions/legal entities
The Monitoring Trustee received the updated quarterly tables and comments from the report as part
of the package to prepare the Monitoring Report.
d.ii. “Regarding the independent controls on portfolio valuation, the Risk Management Department
shall provide a yearly written report, with a file-by-file review on the basis of a predefined samples.”
BMPS states that: an annual report on Credit File Review was not produced yet and will be prepared
for the first time on 2017 data and be ready during Q3 2018:
<U+F0A7> A sample extraction will be carried out on the official year-end data in order to verify the proper
      classification and evaluation of customers. The portfolio will be clustered into the following:
      - Status (distinguishing among Performing, Past due, UtoP and Bad Loans)
      - Presence/absence of Forborne
      - Type of Customer (Corporate, Retail and Other);
<U+F0A7> A sample of 200/300 positions will be selected and analysed for proper classification and
      evaluation according to the following timeframes:
      - February-April: credit file review by the Credit Exposure Controls Service (CRO) – Currently
          working on it as of April 2018,
      - May-June: discussion by SCEC on the results of the CFR with the CLO units,
      - June-July: implementation of any remedial actions identified in the financial statements by
          the CLO,
      - August: check by SCEC of the implementation of any negative findings in the financial
          statements,
      - September: drafting of report to be officially submitted to the Monitoring Trustee
                                                                                                48

                                                                                      6-Aug-18
The Monitoring Trustee shall receive the first sample yearly report during Q3 2018.
e.i. “Granting loans to enable borrowers to purchase shares or instruments counting towards own
funds of the Bank shall be prohibited, whoever those borrowers are. This commitment applies to all
subsidiaries of the Bank, either domestic or foreign.”
BMPS states that: the Document 2054 of 29/06/2017 – Rules on the granting and revision of credit,
paragraph 2.3.3 expressly states that “when analysing the loan’s purpose, particular caution must be
exercised to avoid cases of an unacceptable nature, such as financing for the purchase of
shares/instruments/rights of the bank or of other companies of the Group or to participate in a
capital raising conducted by the Bank” in compliance with Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code which
establishes that the Bank may not, directly or indirectly, grant loans or provide collateral for the
purchase or subscription of own shares/instruments/rights of the Bank of other companies of the
Group or to participate in a capital raising conducted by the Bank.
The Monitoring Trustee shall receive confirmation from BMPS in each report that the Commitment
was respected.
f.i. "The Credit Policy shall give clear instructions on the restructuring of loans. It clearly defines
which loans are eligible, under which circumstances, and indicates the terms and conditions that can
be proposed to eligible customers.”
BMPS states that: On 29/06/2017, the MPS Group issued Document 1791 – Management of Loan
Restructuring Transactions with which it set clear rules for managing the restructuring of loans.
The latter mainly include forborne exposures referred to in the bankruptcy law under Articles 67 and
182bis and managed by the Group’s Loan Restructuring Area. Moreover, the Group Loan
Management Policy (D1991), issued on 10 February 2017, lays down the rules for the classification
and provisioning of such exposures.
The Monitoring Trustee received the documents 1791 and 1991.
f.ii. “The Bank shall ensure that all restructurings aim at enhancing its future recoveries, thus
safeguarding the interest of the Bank. In no case the restructuring policy shall jeopardize the future
profitability of the Bank, and any restructuring proposal should contain an outline of the rationale
behind it.”
BMPS states that: each restructuring plan is supported by an evaluation framework based on
quantifiable and objective parameters which allow the bank to understand the profitability of the
operation by comparing the current value of pre- and post-restructuring cash flows.
f.iii. “For that purpose, the Bank's Risk Management Department shall be responsible for developing
and deploying adequate restructuring effectiveness reporting mechanisms, mainly based on sample
controls reporting its findings at least on a quarterly basis to the Credit Committee and the Board
Risk Committee, suggesting actionable improvements to the processes and policies involved and
oversee and reporting on their implementation to the Credit Committee and the Board Risk
Committee.”
BMPS states that: BMPS will submit a quarterly report to the Credit Committee and Risk Committee
containing results from the synthetic performance indicators such as cure rate, danger rate,
exposure reduction, with a comparison between these parameters and those of the remaining
positions (ideally restructured UtP vs network UtP vs rischio anomalo UtP).

   a) Controls on individual exposures (CFR)
<U+F0A7>  The initial perimeter of control activities included over 5,300 performing credit exposures, for
   which between 1 Sept. 2017 and 31 Dec. 2017 there was a credit approval including lines of
   credit with a purpose (declared or presumed) of refinancing or modification of the contract.
   Through random sampling, 80 positions were selected, of which 30 classified as “High Risk”
   before the granting

   positions were selected
<U+F0A7>  A specific corrective action was requested for 1 case evaluated as non-compliant (equal to 4.3%

     random sampling, 10 positions were selected
<U+F0A7>    Operational compliance is observed in 100% of the reviewed exposures, therefore no specific

The Monitoring Trustee shall receive each quarterly report for verification.
g.i. “The Bank shall enact a claim and litigation policy aiming at maximizing recovery net of the cost
for potential legal procedure and preventing any discrimination or preferential treatment in the
management of litigations. The Bank shall ensure that all necessary actions are taken to maximize
the recoveries for the Bank and protect its financial position in the long-term.”
BMPS states that: The Group issued Document 1755 – Management of claims and litigations on
11/11/2016 which details all the actions needed for recovery without exception, following an
assessment of the actual economic benefit. The document also requires for all necessary actions to
be taken on any guarantors and/or debtors. The Document sets out a number of actions to
maximize the recovery and minimize the time for it, such as:
     <U+F0A7> Analysis of the claims in order to promptly identify the best recovery strategy
     <U+F0A7> Formalization the recovery strategy for each position in a detailed Business Plan,
         highlighting the case for the strategy proposed
     <U+F0A7> Verification of the completeness of the legal documentation to enable all relevant legal
         proceedings
     <U+F0A7> A thorough description of all actionable recovery strategies, highlighting the differences
         between in and out-of-court settlements, legal proceeding (i.e. “procedure concorsuali”),
         secured and unsecured claims
     <U+F0A7> Engagement and close monitoring of legal advisors in case of in-court settlements or legal
         proceedings
The Document 1755 and other internal regulations of BMPS, in compliance with the applicable laws,
provides for no preferential treatment or discrimination in the management of litigations.
Moreover, a specific project (i.e. “project SIRIO”), aiming at outsourcing the management of bad
loans, is ongoing; such project consists in the externalization of the recovery activities of bad loans
to a specialized servicer. The Servicer is an SPV owned by CERVED and QUAESTIO and will manage at
least 80% of the bad loans of the MPS Group, generated from the 1st of January 2017 to the 31st of
December 2027. The project will be finalized by the end of March 2018, ensuring the starting of the
Servicer operations from the 1st of April 2018.
The Agreement with the specialized servicer SIRIO will be regulated by a specific agreement (the
Servicing Agreement) which, among others, regulates the link between the compensation of the
                                                                                              51

Servicer and the net recoveries (net of all direct expenses, including legal expensed) of the
exposures, to guarantee maximization of the recovery.
In addition, in order to ensure full compliance to BMPS internal policies (including Document 1755)
and therefore avoid any preferential treatment and guarantee no discrimination (above-
mentioned), the Servicing Agreement includes also the following:
      <U+F0A7> Clause 6.1 (“Diligence”): Compliance of the Servicer to highest standards of professional
           diligence, applicable laws and regulation, sound and prudent banking practice, Collection
           Policies (which are also a schedule of the Servicing Agreement)
      <U+F0A7> The Collection Policies must be provided by the Servicer, in accordance to principles and
           rules of collection policies of BMPS. The Servicer and BMPS will discuss and agree upon the
           Collection policies in good faith (prior SIRIO project “go-live”)

An example of those report is shown below. The Reports contain the findings from synthetic

portfolio of UtP positions subject to Forborne (mainly include forborne exposures referred to in the
bankruptcy law under Articles 67 and 182bis and managed by the Group’s Loan Restructuring Area).
The indicators will be compared with those observed on the remaining UtP positions.

h …“(ii) assess recoverability of the loan portfolio (including but not limited to alternative repayment
sources such as co-debtors and guarantors as well as collateral pledged or available but not
pledged), through a coverage analysis”…;
BMPS states it is equipped with a tool for evaluating the recoverability of the credit portfolio
governed by an internal policy (D 1991 of 8/2/2018). This policy stipulates that the evaluation of the
credits and the consequent determination of the loss forecasts occurs through the application of
two different methodologies regardless of the regulatory state (i.e. bonis, default).
    1. Statistical evaluation is carried out by statistical models based on parameters estimated by
         the Risk Management function (e.g. Igd, PD;)
    2. Analytical evaluation follows two approaches:
             a. Going concern, which is based on the evaluation of cash flows and is applicable to
                  companies that continue to generate cash flows to be allocated to debt recovery.
             b. Gone concern, which is based on the evaluation of counterparty's collateral and
                  assets, and is applicable to customers in which credit recovery derives mainly from
                  the liquidation of assets or collateral, real and not.
         The analytical evaluation carried out with the going concern approach is executed by the
         Management Relationship or the Function in accordance with the methodology indicated in
                                                                                                53

                                                                                                                  6-Aug-18
               the policy. The analytical evaluation carried out by the gone concern approach is, on the
               other hand, executed by the support of the "Tool of Evaluation Gone Concern ". Such a tool
               represents a support that guide the evaluator in the estimation path and, through the
               insertion of information, it calculates the amount covered by the collateral in case of
               enforcement and the corresponding doubtful loans of each single credit line.
The table below summarizes the results of all the methodologies described above. The table shows
the overall breakdown of total loan portfolio and coverage by segment (Retail/Corporate/Other),
status (Performing/non Performing and for Non Performing, Past Due/Unlikely to pay/bad Loans)
and type of collateral.

h. …“(iii) Assess the overall exposure of the Bank to an individual customer or on a portfolio basis,
monitoring the actual implementation of “Politiche Creditizie”…
BMPS provided reports to assess the exposure on a portfolio basis (actual vs targeted) but not
evidence of individual basis. BMPS represents that a quarterly report exits on “name by name” risk
concentration.
The Monitoring Trustee received the report on individual risk concentration.
h. … “(iv) Propose corrective and improvement actions to the Board of Directors, based on explicit
RAS Appetite and Tolerance levels defined by the Board itself, or to the appropriate escalation level
accordingly to the Limit system defined by the CEO”….
BMPS did provide the monitoring Trustee with a sample of the tool to identify the above mentioned

Moreover, BMPS provided elements to control and alert on portfolio wide situations. BMPS stated
that:
On 12.04.2017 the Parent Company’s BoD approved the Montapaschi Group’s Risk Appetite
Statement 2017 (RAS 2017), cascaded down by Legal Entity and Business Unit. At Group-level, the
Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is regulated internally by Directive D01930.
<U+F0A7> If the Risk Tolerance thresholds are exceeded, an escalation process towards the Board of
        Directors is activated in order to authorise the Risk Capacity overrun or implement the remedial
        actions required to bring the Risk Profile back to within the pre-established threshold, by way of
        the following:
        - Group/BU overrun: the CEO formulates a proposal for the BoD of the Parent Company
               (having first consulted with the Risk Committee);
        - Legal Entity overrun: The Head of Corporate Reporting in question alerts the Subsidiary’s
               BoD;
<U+F0A7> If the Risk Capacity thresholds are exceeded, the escalation process towards the Bod of the
        Parent Company is always activated in order to authorised the remedial actions required to
        bring the Risk Profile back to within the pre-established thresholds, by way of the following:
        - Group/BU overrun: the CEO formulates a proposal for the BoD of the Parent Company
               (having first consulted with the Risk Committee);
        - Legal Entity overrun: the CEO formulates a proposal for the BoD of the Parent Company
               (having first consulted with the CR) and the Head of Corporate Reporting in question
               informs the Subsidiary’s BoD.
Monitoring is carried out by the Risk Control Function. A signal («Check») is given for each indicator
according to the following ascending order of alarm:
        - «OK» identifies compliance with Risk Appetite objectives, which also means compliance
               with the Risk Tolerance/Capacity thresholds;
                                                                                                                                55

        -       «Alert» identifies non-compliance with Risk Appetite objectives, despite remaining within
                the Risk Tolerance/Capacity thresholds;
        -       «Tolerance» identifies an overrun of the Risk Tolerance and Risk Appetite thresholds, but
                not of the Risk Capacity threshold;
        -       «BREACH» identifies an overrun of the Risk Capacity threshold too.
The Monitoring Trustee shall receive a quarterly update for verification.
h. … “The Monitoring Trustee shall be given access to that information.”
The Monitoring Trustee shall require BMPS to show evidence of compliance with the Commitment
regarding hi-hii-hiii-hiv.
i.i. “The Bank shall manage the existing commercial assets in a way that maximises Net Present
Value (NPV) of the assets in accordance with normal commercial practice and fiduciary duties.
Specifically, if a client cannot respect the terms of his loan, the Bank shall only restructure the
lending terms (deferral or partial waiver of repayments, conversion of (part of) the claim in capital,
etc.) if such a restructuring leads to enhancing the present value of the loan (i.e. if the present value
of the cash flows to be expected from the restructuring is higher than the present value of the cash
flows which can be expected from liquidation). In exceptional and duly justified circumstances,
judgmental elements relevant for the decision but not included in the NPV calculation should be
properly documented and assessed.”
BMPS states that: Without prejudice to Commitment 12F, on 29/06/2017, the MPS Group issued
Document 1791 – Management of Loan Restructuring Transactions with which it set clear rules for
managing the restructuring of loans. Each restructuring plan is supported by an evaluation
framework based on quantifiable and objective parameters which allow the bank to understand the
profitability of the operation by comparing the current value of pre- and post-restructuring cash
flows.
In addition the bank issued the document «Rules on the granting of a moratorium» (D2094 of
30/03/2016) provides guidelines for managing moratoria and already contains instructions for
assessing repayment capacity. In particular, it describes the preliminary activities regarding
assessment of the borrower to determine whether a moratorium is justifiable and whether the
moratorium is the most appropriate way of overcoming the temporary financial distress detected on
the customer in order to allow them to resume regular repayments. The assessment is broken down
by type of customer (Retail and corporate) and different types of moratoria (e.g. rescheduling,
partial or total waiver, etc.).

j. “As regards the Bank's mortgage assets, the obligations that apply to the commercial assets shall
apply mutatis mutandis. The Bank, in particular, shall be allowed to restructure its mortgage assets
via the following variations to the terms of existing mortgages i) a change of deal (e.g. by offering a
new fixed rate); ii) transferring existing mortgages to new properties; and iii) transferring equity (e.g.
adding a borrower to the mortgage or removing one. In exceptional and duly justified
circumstances, judgmental elements relevant for the decision but not included in the NPV
calculation should be properly documented and assessed.”
BMPS states that: The document «Rules on the granting of a moratorium» (D2094 of 30/03/2016
contains instructions for assessing a customer’s repayment capacity and provides for different types
of moratoria which can be attributable to the Commitment 12A (e.g. rescheduling, etc.). Though
there are viable options for managing exposures, the MPS Group does not adopt the restructuring
arrangements referred to in points ii) and iii) of the commitments since they entail legal
repercussions in terms of collateral coverage as well as legal risks for the Bank. Therefore, the Bank
believes it should limit itself to using the arrangement in point i) since the Group’s policies and
processes on this are compliant with the commitment requirements.
The Monitoring Trustee was told by BMPS that restructuring of mortgages was decided at branch
level for retail clients, within the guidelines. BMPS doesn’t record each individual cases.

It should be noted that BMPS is in the process of renegotiating rates on deposits on all maturities to
reduce the gap with the System. The table below highlights that the trend of deposit price has
improved since the peak of August 2017.

3.13.2 List of issues arising
Point of attention: BMPS still needs to finalise the identification of relative persons and legal entities
controlled by the Relevant Employees/Directors and Managers through a specific questionnaire to
Relevant Employees/Directors and Managers (sent in May 2018).
3.13.3 Description of the commitment (A13)
    a) Within the Credit Policy, a specific section shall be devoted to the rules governing relations
        with connected borrowers. Connected borrowers include relevant employees (i.e. risk takers
        which are identified in the Bank’s Global Policy on related and connected parties in order to
        prevent conflict of interests and which are involved in the decision-making process of the
        Credit Policy), significant shareholders, directors or managers, as well as their spouses,
        children and siblings and any legal entity directly or indirectly controlled by relevant
        employees (as defined above), significant shareholders, directors or managers or their
        spouses, children and siblings. By extension, any public institution or government-controlled
        organization, any public company or government agency shall be considered as a connected
        borrower only for the purposes of the credit assessment and pricing policies. Political parties
        when receiving any loans or when their loans are subject to restructuring, shall also be
        treated as connected borrowers in the Credit Policy for the above purposes. Particular focus
        shall be on decisions regarding any restructuring and write downs of loans to relevant
        employees, directors, shareholders or managers and their relatives as well as policies
        followed in the appropriateness, valuation, registration of liens and foreclosure of loan
        collateral.
    b) The credit assessment of the connected borrowers, as well as the pricing conditions and
        possible restructuring offered to them, shall not be more advantageous compared to
        conditions offered to similar but unconnected borrowers, in order to secure a level-playing
        field. If a comparable (similar but unconnected) borrower is not available, credit assessment
        as well as the pricing conditions and possible restructuring shall be performed/offered
        accordingly to Credit Policy (credit assessment and restructuring) and Commercial Policy
        (pricing conditions).
    c) The restructuring of loans involving connected borrowers shall comply with the same
        requirements as for non-connected borrowers. However, it is expected that restructured
        loans of connected borrowers shall be reported separately, at least per loan asset class and
        connected borrower type.
                                                                                                        59

3.13.4 Description of the steps taken
BMPS and the Monitoring trustee have reviewed the definition of the Commitments to define clearly
its scope along the following lines:
WHO TO MONITOR
“Connected borrowers include:
 a) relevant employees (i.e. risk takers which are identified in the Bank’s Global Policy on related
      and connected parties in order to prevent conflict of interests and which are involved in the
      decision-making process of the Credit Policy),
 b) significant shareholders,
 c) directors or managers, as well as their spouses, children and siblings, and
 d) any legal entity directly or indirectly controlled by relevant employees (as defined above),
      significant shareholders, directors or managers or their spouses, children and siblings.
 e) By extension, any public institution or
 f) government-controlled organization,
 g) any public company or
 h) government agency shall be considered as a connected borrower only for the purposes of the
      credit assessment and pricing policies.
 i) Political parties when receiving any loans or when their loans are subject to restructuring, shall
      also be treated as connected borrowers in the Credit Policy for the above purposes.”
WHAT TO MONITOR
a) Credit Policy update: “Within the Credit Policy, a specific section shall be devoted to the rules
     governing relations with connected borrowers”
b) Credit assessment and pricing policies: “The credit assessment of the connected borrowers, as
     well as the pricing conditions and possible restructuring offered to them, shall not be more
     advantageous compared to conditions offered to similar but unconnected borrowers”
c) Restructuring and write downs:
          o “shall comply with the same requirements as for non-connected borrowers”
          o “restructured loans of connected borrowers shall be reported separately, at least per
               loan asset class and connected borrower type”
Implementation
BMPS has defined all the rules that establish the perimeter of the Connected Borrowers and the
process to be respected in granting credit in favour of the aforementioned clients.
The measures required to be compliant with the commitment are as follows:
<U+F0A7> DONE in Q1 2018 - Definition of scope of connected borrowers;
<U+F0A7> DONE in Q4 2017 - Allocation of a specific ID code in the Master Data which ensures compliance
     with the ex ante commitment and ex post monitoring, also through the reports to be submitted
     for monitoring purposes;
<U+F0A7> DONE in Q1 2018 - Drafting of a Connected Borrowers Policy and definition of related process
     with allocation of responsibilities to the new activities (approve by the Board on 10 May 2018).
<U+F0A7> DONE in Q2 2018 – Integrated the credit Policy with a specific section that refers to the
     Connceted Borrowers Policy that rules governing relations with connected borrowers”
<U+F0A7> IN PROGRESS - Distribution of a questionnaire to Relevant Employees (involved in the decision-
     making process of the Credit Policy as defined below) and Directors/Managers already identified
     Connected Borrowers to declare their potential connected parties (sent in May 2018).
                                                                                                      60

                                                                                                 6-Aug-18
Connected Borrowers’ Scope
An “active” and a “passive” scope have been identified:
<U+F0A7> The “active” scope are the lenders within BMPS and include all Italian and foreign Banks of the
     Banking Group which carry out banking activities (lending, leasing and factoring): BMPS –
     including Foreign Branches, WIDIBA, MPS CS, MPS L&F, MP BELGIO, MPS BANQUE.
<U+F0A7> The “passive” scope are the borrowers and include the connected borrowers of all the
     Banks/Companies belonging to the MPS Group: BMPS – including Foreign Branches, (e.g.
     WIDIBA, MPS CS, MPS L&F, MP BELGIO, MP BANQUE, MP FIDUCIARIA, CONSORZIO OPERATIVO
     MPS, MONTEPASCHI LUXENBOURG) and the other Companies included in the MPS Group’s area
     of consolidation for statutory (or supervisory) purposes.
Connected Borrowers’ Perimeter
Connected Borrowers as defined by BMPS in its systems includes the following:
1- Relevant employees, directors and managers:
<U+F0A7> Relevant employees: Risk Takers of the MPS Group, as identified for the Global Policy, who are
     involved in the Credit decision-making processes (therefore not all Risk Takers are Connected
     Borrowers)
<U+F0A7> Directors and Managers: (i) For BMPS: Managers (Chief and Head of Control Functions) and
     directors and auditors (ii) For the other Banks/Companies: strategic managers (up to first-line)
2- Significant Shareholders: All significant shareholders for Bankit Provisions and Consob for
purposes of Reg 17221 (Consob Related Parties). It should be noted that they will also be included in
the scope of all MEF subsidiaries, as identified by the regulations on Related Parties/Connected
Persons.
3- Political Parties: Political parties recorded as such in the Group Master Data (trx VPRA). It has
been decided to extend the ID code to legal representatives with power of attorney.
4- Public Institutions / Government Controlled Organizations / Public Companies / Government
Agencies: All companies classified as PUB and Companies controlled by PUB in the master data and
their subsidiaries based on the information from the application GCC – Groups of Connected Clients
Regarding categories #1 and #2 in includes also Relatives persons and legal entities controlled by
them either directly or indirectly: spouses, children, siblings, parents and all companies controlled
directly by Connected Borrowers. In line with Consob regulations, BMPS have extended the scope to
include parents even though this is not required by the Commitment.
The following tables present the number and exposures related to the Connected Borrowers

BMPS Policy related to Connected Borrowers
The Board of BMPS have adopted a Connected Borrowers Policy on 10 May 2018 along the following
lines:
<U+F0A7> Scope
        - The scope of the Policy is the definition of the rules suitable to guard against the risk that the
               proximity of the Connected Borrowers to the decision-making centers of the Bank could
               compromise the objectivity and impartiality of the evaluations regarding the granting of
               loans to the same subjects.
        - In credit operations in favor of customers classified as Connected Borrowers, regardless of
               the creditworthiness must be applied and consequently economic pricing conditions must be
               no more favorable than those applied in favor of customers not included in the scope of the
               Connected Borrowers (i.e. unconnected borrowers).
        - It should be noted that the above considerations apply to all types of counterparties
               classified as Connected Borrowers, including therefore also Non-Performing positions
               (Unlikely To Pay / Non Performing Loans).
        - The Policy defines the organizational system adopted by the "Methods and methodologies in
               the field of Connected Borrowers".
        - The Parent Company MPS identifies and maintains the perimeter of Connected Borrowers,
               defining the rules to which the Banks and Companies of the active perimeter must comply.
        - The definition and governance of the organizational process model is centralized at the
               Parent Company that defines the criteria, guidelines and measures. Each Bank / Company of
                                                                                                                                                    62

                                                                                          6-Aug-18
      the Group must comply with these rules for the management of counterparties connected
      borrowers.
  - The implementation and maintenance of the rules to identify the Connected Borrowers in
      the master data system is centralized throughout on the Group Operating Consortium, with
      the exception of non-associated companies (i.e. MP BELGIO and MPS BANQUE). For these
      last two Banks, the updating of the Connected Borrowers’ perimeter is managed through a
      monthly sending list by the Parent Company MPS.
<U+F0A7> Rules and Criteria
  - The Policy defines the organizational system adopted by the "Methods and methodologies in
      the field of Connected Borrowers".
  - The Parent Company MPS identifies and maintains the perimeter of Connected Borrowers,
      defining the rules to which the Banks and Companies of the active perimeter (see Section 2)
      must comply.
  - The definition and governance of the organizational process model is centralized at the
      Parent Company that defines the criteria, guidelines and measures. Each Bank / Company of
      the Group must comply with these rules for the management of counterparties connected
      borrowers.
  - The implementation and maintenance of the rules to identify the Connected Borrowers in
      the master data system is centralized throughout on the Group Operating Consortium, with
      the exception of non-associated companies (i.e. MP BELGIO and MPS BANQUE). For these
      last two Banks, the updating of the Connected Borrowers’ perimeter is managed through a
      monthly sending list by the Parent Company MPS.
  - Concerning assignments in favor of the Connected Borrowers it should be noted that no
      economic pricing conditions others than the standard ones are allowed: if the conditions
      proposed in a credit operation to a Connected Borrower are more advantageous than the
      ordinary, this operation cannot be authorized and it must be declined or the conditions must
      be adjusted so that they are within the average of those usually applied in similar
      transactions with unconnected borrowers.
  - To determine conditions no more favorable than those usually applied, the concept of
      “market / standard conditions” is used as defined for transactions with Consob Related
      Parties (D01978 and D01556), thus referring to the conditions applied to similar transactions
      with respects to its nature, amount and risk.
  - Nature: compare with operations having the same technical form. In the absence of itself
      technical form, we draw on macrotypologies consistent with the technical forms used in the
      construction of LGD grids;
  - Amount: refer to the agreement (in the case of a loan with amortization, the original
      agreement is intended);
  - Risk: compare with customers of the same market segment and having the same Rating. In
      absence of a significant number of similar cases of customers with same rating, the search
      for customer-like cases can be extended to the same market segment and which has an
      inclusive rating between 1 notch above and going down to D3.
  - For the verification that the pricing applied to the credit operation in favor of a Connected
      Borrower is no more advantageous than that usually applied to a non connected borrower,
      the Commercial Officer must certify “ex ante” that the pricing conditions that it intends to
      apply are standard in specific cases: this certification contains a significant number of
      transactions with similar cases of unconnected borrowers who received the same economic
      treatment in the same period.
  - The Credit Officer (“proposer”) shall checks this certification and includes it in the Credit
      Operation form.
  - For credit operations in favor of Connected Borrowers, the decision-making autonomy does
      not change.
                                                                                                 63

                                                                                               6-Aug-18
  - The choice to maintain the ordinary decision-maker is justified by the presence of ex ante
    and ex post checks to oversee the no more favorable economic treatment is given. Increasing
    the decision-making responsibility or centralizing at the MPS parent company the resolutions
    by the other Banks/Companies of the GMPS would have meant to significantly reduce the
    response times for the disbursement of the loans, the efficiency and effectiveness in the
    provision of credit.
  - “Ex post” it should be possible verify that the applied pricing is within the average of those
    usually applied, as shown by the detailed reporting of similar operations included in the
    Credit operation form.
  - BMPS quarterly extracts all the credit operations approved in favor of Connected Borrowers
    (Performing and Non Performing) whether it is a new credit or a revision (the automatic
    credit revisions are inhibited for the Connected Borrowers), thanks to the Connected
    Borrower personal information code.
  - Other Banks / Companies of GMPS shall quarterly report to the MPS Parent Company all the
    credit operations approved in favor of Connected Borrowers (Performing and Non
    Performing), specifying whether it is a new credit or a revision.
  - Public Administrations/Institutions (hereinafter PA/PIs) deserve an “ad hoc” treatment.
  - All PA/PIs are Connected Borrowers, therefore it’s not possible to find similar customers not
    included in the perimeter for a comparison of transactions. PA/PIs are also not rated and,
    therefore, it’s not possible to classify their risk with standard merit classes of Rating.
  - Therefore, for credit operations in favor of PA/PIs, the Policy sets out rules and pricing
    criteria that allow for an "ex ante" certification and an "ex post" verification that conditions
    not more advantageous than usual were applied. For credit operations in favor of Public
    Bodies:
         o as they are not rated, reference is made to corporate customers classified as NC / ND
             / SR; if there is not a significant number of transactions between the NC / ND / SR,
             then it is compared with customers with rating C1 or worse than C1 (on the
             assumption that C1 is assimilated to NC).
         o when MPS Group participates in a public tender, two cases may occur: 1) the
             conditions are established by law and are in fact the only applicable conditions, so
             this information must be appropriately represented in the credit proposal; 2) the
             conditions are offered by the MPS Group in accordance with the Tender File and it is
             therefore necessary to prove that the same would also apply to customers not
             belonging to the perimeter;
  - when credit operations are within the scope of services already agreed on and, therefore,
    the conditions cannot be changed (even they were not still standard / market), this
    information must be appropriately represented in the credit proposal
<U+F0A7> Monitoring and Reporting
  - In order to be fully compliant with the Commitment 13, as set out in the Policy, the
    compliance of transactions carried out on the clients classified Connected Borrowers must be
    constantly monitored.
  - For the entire period of the Restructuring Plan (2017-2021), BMPS shall report to the
    Monitoring Trustee the economic pricing treatment applied to the Connected Borrowers in
    the MPS Group's credit operations for the Monitoring Trustee.
  - The credit operations approved in favor of Connected Borrowers must, therefore, contain
    the elements of judgment necessary to prove the analysis carried out. The Credit Officer
    (“proposer”) must report in the in the credit granting process in favor of a Connected
    Borrower as certified by the Commercial Officer, i.e. that the economic pricing treatment
    applied is the same that the Bank ordinarily applies to similar customer in similar
    transactions.
  - In consideration of the specificity and complexity of transactions relating to Non-Performing
    positions (UTP / NPL), they must be accounted for in detail showing all the requirements and
                                                                                                     64

                                                                                           6-Aug-18
     valuation criteria applied so as to show that they are the same applied in favor of similar but
     unconnected borrowers.
<U+F0A7> Responsibilities
  - The Parent Company MPS shall report to the Board Members all credit operations authorized
     in favor of Connected Borrowers from all the Banks and Companies of the “active
     perimeter”.
  - To this end, the Banks and Companies of the “active perimeter” shall report to the Parent
     Company all the operations authorized in favor of Connected Borrowers.
  - The Parent Company also provides support and advice to the Banks and Companies of the
     “active perimeter” in order to the correctly assess the perimeter of the counterparty and the
     credit.
                                                                                                  65

At the beginning of July 2017, the counterparts interested in participating to the process signed a
confidentiality agreement with BMPS
Starting from July 10th, 2017, Rothschild dispatched to the #10 counterparties that signed the
confidentiality agreement:
     - the phase I process letter (non-binding phase) outlining the content of the non-binding offers
         (“NBO”) and envisaging a deadline for the submission of the NBO by July 30th 2017

Wyman (“OW”) to map out the process of such wind-down. The mission should take about 4 weeks
the OW team told to the Monitoring Trustee on 18 June 2018. The CFO has met Banque de France on
20 June 2018 to inform them that they will enter in a wind-down process.
The Monitoring Trustee told to BMPS that from 1 July 2018 they are forbidden to make new loans
and accept new business, BMPS agreed.
                                                                                                   67

In June/July 2017, Rothschild launched a process and contacted #33 potential buyers (including local
banks, foreign banks, PEHs and other potential investors)
At the beginning of July 2017, the counterparts interested in participating to the process signed a

Starting from July 10th, 2017, Rothschild dispatched to the #10 counterparties that signed the

            (“NBO”) and envisaging a deadline for the submission of the NBO by July 30th 2017
      - the infopacks including an overview and key data of the Foreign Banks
By the deadline for the submission, 6 counterparties submitted an offer for BMP Belgio, with a price
ranged between €12m and €55m (0.1x – 0.6x 1Q17 BV).
Rothschild sent the Phase II (binding phase) process letters at the end of August 2017.
From September 7th 2017, potential buyers selected for Phase II had the possibility to start the due
diligence exercise including:
                                                                                                         68

    - Access to the virtual data room (“VDR”) which was open until December 10th 2017
    - Credit files review (October 2017)
    - Management presentations with specific Q&A session (October 2017)
On October 23rd 2017 the share purchase agreements have been uploaded in the VDR.
Following the requests of several buyers binding offers deadline has been postponed to December
11th 2017 (from November 13th).
On 11th December 2017, BMPS had received 2 offers:
    - A Binding Offer from Barents Re with a purchase price equal to €42m (0.4x BV as of 3Q17) to
        be paid as follows: (i) €12m at closing (0.1x BV as of 3Q17) and (ii) €30m to be paid at the end
        of the third year post closing. The deferred purchase price will serve as a guarantee for the
        purchaser for any losses resulting from a list of identified risks.
            o On 25 January 2018, BMPS met the National Bank of Belgium to discuss about the
                 potential transaction.
            o On 23 February, BMPS and Barents RE met with NBB and ECB to present Barents RE
                 strategy and expected shareholders structure of BMPS Belgium
        BMPS has requested Barents RE to increase its offer price and limit the representation and
        warranties included in his offer in order to get to a more binding agreement. Barents RE is
        performing a second round of due diligence on selective issues. Barents RE has requested
        BMPS to maintain some funding lines: BMPS is reviewing the maximum amount of funding to
        be provided considering potential collaterals, capital absorption and related risks. Barents RE
        set as condition precedence that NATO (the largest depositor) shall confirm that does not
        intend to materially divest or withdraw its deposits as a result of the transaction. This needs
        to be verified with NATO.
        As of July 2018, BMPS do not have any ongoing discussion with Barents.
    - A Non-Binding Offer from BKB Bank of €38m (0.35x BV as of 3Q17) to be paid in cash,
        subject to due diligence. Following completion of the acquisition of Oldenburgische
        Landesbank (OLB) by Bremer Kreditbank (BKB), an Apollo portfolio company, Apollo has
        reconfirmed interest in the acquisition of MPS Belgio which will be pursued independently
        from BKB. As a result of these latest developments Apollo re-initiated due diligence at the
        end of February 2018 but stopped the process in Q2 2018.
Around mid-April a private equity fund, Warburg Pincus requested to enter in the process
    - After a due diligence phase, on May 29th it submitted a final offer together with an SPA
        mark-up
    - The key issue is the €750m liquidity line requested by the National Bank of Belgium following
        a stress test, that should be reduced in order to make the deal possible. In fact, Warburg
        cannot provide any liquidity line. The liquidity line should be provided by BMPS, that is
        assessing its terms and maximum amount
        <U+F0B7> BMPS met the NBB on June 7th in order to reduce the liquidity line in the light of an
            updated stress test. In addition, even in the worst liquidity crisis of the parent company,
            the liquidity line was called for just 50% of the total amount. The National Bank of
            Belgium has not yet provided any feedback
        <U+F0B7> In addition, in order to further reduce the funding requirements, BMPS may purchase
            BMP Belgio syndicated loan book (ca. €180mln)
        <U+F0B7> BMPS Credit Department is reviewing the maximum liquidity line that can offer to BMP
            Belgio, after the disposal of the syndicated loan book
    - Warburg has requested some representations and warranties and indemnities, mainly
        concentrated on IT system and some specific credit files. BMPS is trying to mitigate these
        issues in the due diligence
    - On July 23, BMPS is discussing with Warburg rep and warranties, price and line of credit
                                                                                                      69

To explore fully the single binding offer received, BMPS asked a delay to the DG Comp to maintain
the normal activity of the subsidiary. This request was accepted by the DG Comp provided the
Monitoring Trustee is informed immediately of material evolutions.

banking licences for each branches by 31/12/2018 as it didn’t identify hard roadblocks on the path to
that goal.

NPLs                                             junior notes on June 22, 2018 and achieved
                                                 deconsolidation. Moreover, BMPS obtained the
                                                 “investment grade” rating from 3 agencies on all
                                                 senior notes (merging A1 and A2 into a single A
                                                 notes). The next step is to receive GACS on the A
                                                 notes removing the RWA weighting. BMPS will keep

3.16.2 List of issues arising
No issue to report to date
Point of attention
BMPS has realised the derecognition of the NPL SPV, by selling the junior notes. The senior A notes’
tranching exceeded Restructuring Plan expectations, which initially contemplated a class of Non-
Investment Grade notes for approximately €500 million that will therefore not be issued. Once GACS
are obtained, the senior A notes will have no RWA associated hence will not face the limit calculation
of large exposures (25% of eligible capital). Consequently, BMPS intend to keep the Senior A notes,
which will be assisted by GACS, for the foreseeable future.
3.16.3 Description of the commitment (A.16)
The Bank shall achieve de-recognition of EUR 26.1 billion GBV (value at 31/12/2016)] bad loans

3.17.3 Description of the commitment (A.17)
Without prejudice of what is set forth in the relevant terms and conditions the Bank shall unwind the
closed real estate fund Perimetro Gestione Proprietà Immobiliari and any other existing closed real
estate funds set up by the Bank by 31/12/2019. The Bank shall dispose of EUR 500 million of real
estate properties by 31/12/2021.
3.17.4 Description of the steps taken
Perimeter
BMPS real estate portfolio consists of 1,283 real estate properties with a book value of €2,350m, of
which €1,375m (ca. 59%) belonging to the sale and lease-back securitization portfolio Perimetro and
€975m owned by BMPS and other group companies. The real estate portfolio is mainly concentrated
in Tuscany (Siena and Florence), Lombardy (Milan), Lazio (Rome) and Veneto (Padua).
BMPS identified a perimeter of approximately 90 real estate properties (actually Bank’s Head Offices,
Regional Areas and branches) have been identified as available for sale (some of them are still owned
by Perimetro GPI), located in the most important Italian cities.
The book value of these real estate portfolio to be sold is ca. EUR 650m. BMPS will select the real
estates to be disposed taking into account its commercial strategy as well as the commitment taken
with DG Comp.
Execution
BMPS is collecting all the technical and legal information for the real estates to be included in the
dataroom. The dataroom is expected to be completed in 2H 2018 in order to ask for the offers in
2018. Approx. 75 properties out of 90 have been analysed and 67 of them (90%) need some months
to have the VDR documentation completed. The Real Estate Team proceeds with collecting the
documentation.
BMPS informs that 7 real estate properties (€17,4m) have been sold in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018.
                                                                                                      81

                                                                                                     6-Aug-18
In Q1 2018, BMPS has filed a request with Consob on a potential tender offer in 2018 on
“Perimetro” senior notes to be able to unwind the structure. BMPS expects to launch a tender offer
in H2 2018 on “Perimetro” senior notes.
Focus on Perimetro
The disposal of the real estate assets owned by Perimetro could be complex because Perimetro is
part of a complex securitisation transaction. The restructuring of Perimetro is legally complex (some
tranches are privately owned) and must be discussed with market regulators. The costs of
unwinding hedge positions should also be taken into account.
Perimetro Gestione Proprietà Immobiliari S.C.p.A. (“PGPI”) is a consortium which was constituted in
2009 with the contribution in kind by MPS Immobiliare S.p.A. of a business unit comprising the real
estate properties in which branches, offices and EDP centres belonging to BMPS were housed. At
the time of incorporation, the number of contributed properties was 683, for a total value of over
€1.7bn. All were leased to BMPS with a double net lease contract of 24+6 years, at an initial fee of
about €101m (5.89% yield).
BMPS also explained that the disposal would be carried out in the whole business plan period, in
order to:
    I.     Maximize disposal price of the real estate portfolio taking into account the current negative
           real estate market momentum in Italy. The carry value of the real estate portfolio is close to
           market value;
   II.     Minimize the negative commercial impact of leaving some prime location;
  III.     Timeframe necessary for the restructuring/unwinding of Perimetro which will require
           discussions with Consob;
  IV.      Minimize any logistical / relocation issue. BMPS conducted a preliminary analysis aimed at
           streamlining the real estate offices and concentrating headquarters in fewer locations.
BMPS explains that the rationale of the disposal is a complex reorganization which includes the
transfer – in the major cities - of a total of ca. 2,000 employees from several buildings in the city
centers to one or two buildings in suburban areas and a representative office in the city center. This
includes several activities which are detailed below. BMPS is currently focused on Phase 2 of its plan
presented below:
Phase 1. Strategic analysis of the Bank's real estate portfolio to identify the properties to be sold:
<U+F0A7> Analysis of the properties included in the disposal perimeter, of all existing documentation, of
      the technical due diligence and identification of possible integration needs;
<U+F0A7> Development of the City Plans, in particular, for main cities including Milan, Rome, Siena,
      Florence and Padua, in order to identify possible needs deriving from the sale of the properties
      included in the disposal perimeter ;
<U+F0A7> Evaluation and analysis of the actual state of the properties, with an indication of the potential
      "best use" value, i.e. the applicable value should the destination of each property be modified in
      order to maximise its value;
<U+F0A7> Comparative analysis of the investments necessary for their maintenance/sale.
Phase 2. Preparatory activities for the sales process
<U+F0A7> Identification of a possible strategy to maximise the sale value of the properties, including
      grouping of properties in specific clusters, identification of the marketing strategy and of the
      strengths and weaknesses of individual properties. Identification of initiatives aimed at mitigating
      critical issues (e.g. lack of documentation, critical issues related to individual properties, etc.);
                                                                                                            82

<U+F0A7>  Preparation and collection of the necessary documentation for the sale of individual
   properties/clusters of properties, such as the cadastral documentation, energy certification,
   compliance of installations and environmental risk;
<U+F0A7>  Preparation and subsequent management of the virtual/physical Data Room needed by
   potentially interested parties: setting up the data room and supporting the integration of missing
   technical documentation;
<U+F0A7>  Support in identifying potential investors to invite to the sale of the real estate portfolio;
<U+F0A7>  Preparation of teasers and information packages to be sent to potentially interested parties.
Phase 3. Sales Process
<U+F0A7> Virtual and Physical Data Room management. Q&A data room management;
<U+F0A7> Promotion of properties for sale, on-site visits with potential buyers and market trend reports for
   different locations;
<U+F0A7> Evaluation and negotiation of all the offers received;
<U+F0A7> Update the analysis according to specific requests of the counterparties involved in the process
<U+F0A7> Preparation and negotiation of the contracts with particular reference to the environmental and
   urban-building issues and to the clauses to be included in the contracts (preliminary and final
   between the parties) to protect the responsibilities of the Bank ;
<U+F0A7> Confirmation of the saleability of the properties with reference to the cadastral documentation,
   energy certification, compliance of installations and environmental risk.
Phase 4. Identification and renting new properties
<U+F0A7> Identification of the new instrumental properties to be leased;
<U+F0A7> Negotiations of the new rental contracts ;
<U+F0A7> Transfer of employees to the new locations.
                                                                                                       83

Participations listed in “c)” of the Commitment (“Other minority stakes”):
During 2017 the minorities sold by BMPS have been n.6 for a total amount of €0.9m and a positive
impact on the P&L of €0.1m. Furthermore other 4 participations have generated incomes (due to
different cause i.e. partially sell, unwinding, capital distribution, etc.) for €1.6m with a positive impact
on the P&L for €0.6m.
During the first quarter of 2018 the minorities sold by BMPS have been n. 3 for a total amount of
€3.2 million and a positive impact on the P&L of €3.2 million. Furthermore other 5 participations
have been closed for withdrawal or closure of the company without impacts on the income
statement.
As the date, BMPS owns stakes in a total (excluding stake in strategic joint venture with Axa) of 162
for a total carrying value of €323.62m. The table below presents the main minorities equity holdings

3.19.2 List of issues arising
Disposal of the art collection (#19): BMPS has about 11.000 artwork free of constraints with a book
value of only about €5.2m. Those pieces are considered unattractive in an auction, time consuming
to sell, and expensive to replace (furniture, graphics decorating walls). BMPS proposes to amend the
commitment and to sell 12 artworks attributed to Kandinskji (seized as collateral and currently under
authenticity assessment). However, EC DG Competition requires BMPS to proceed nevertheless with
the execution of the Commitment, and BMPS registers its intent to further discuss this point with EC
DG Competition.
3.19.3 Description of the commitment (A.19)
The Bank shall dispose all the artworks that form its art collection by the end of the restructuring
period, provided that their sale complies with the relevant provisions of Italian National Legislation
and that the sale price is at least equal to the carrying value of the artwork to be sold. This
commitment does not apply to the artworks under the “pertinenzialità” constraint or to any other
provision or of the Italian National Legislation that restricts disposability.
3.19.4 Description of the steps taken
BMPS identified an artistic heritage of approx. 30.700 artworks with a book value of ca. €121m,
where the 45 most important artworks have a total value of ca. €52 million (43% over the total
value). It is worth noting that, in October the Italian Cultural Authority has put under review an
important part of Bank’s portfolio and BMPS have no visibility on when it will complete this analysis:
    - Artwork under constraints which cannot be disposed: approx. 19.850 artworks (ca.
          €115.8mln) are subject to the “pertinenzialità” constraint or to any other provision of the
          Italian National Legislation that prevents or restricts disposability. This category includes the
          most important Bank’s artwork exhibited at the Chigiana Academy, located in Siena. The
          book value of these artwork is equal to EUR 65 million and the majority of which are
          paintings (€59 million), while the remaining artworks are mainly sculptures, prints and
          engravings, furniture and other objects (€6 million).
    - ArtWork waiting to be constraint: include the n.85 works with notification request made at
          the end of 2017 at the Superintendence and the collection of the '900 still under contract for
          a total value of about 5.9 million
    - Artwork with no constraints: ca. 11.000 artworks are free from constraints and available for
          sale (ca. €5.2 million). However, out of 11,000 artworks, there are only 103 with a value
          above € 10,000 for a total value of 3.8 million mainly located in Padova (former Antonveneta
                                                                                                         87

       Bank). However, the Soprintendenza of Padova may open a notification process to assess
       these artworks. The remaining artworks are made up of graphics (especially lithographs) and
       furniture (tables, chairs, etc.) and would need to be replaced in case of disposal. The disposal
       of these 11.000 artworks might extremely time consuming as, due to their limited value,
       they should be sold one by one and it is unlikely that they attract any interest from
       professional auctions or other intermediaries
During Q1 2018, BMPS has seized as collateral 12 art works that may be attributed to Kandinskji, for
which BMPS is assessing their authenticity.
                                                                                                    88

Italy shall ensure that each State-owned bank shall remain a separate economic unit with
independent powers of decision within the meaning of the EC Merger Regulation and the
Jurisdictional Notice. In particular, Italy commits that:
     a) any confidential, commercially sensitive or personal information provided to government
          bodies and marked as such will be treated accordingly and not circulated to other banks and
          undertakings in which Italy has a stake;
     b) Italy will manage and maintain its stake in the Bank separately from the management of its
          interests in any other bank in which it has a stake;
     c) the exercise of any rights held by Italy and the management of Italy's interests in any bank
          shall be on a commercial basis and shall not prevent, restrict, distort or significantly lessen
          nor impede effective competition. Any disposal of Italy's shareholding must be conducted in
          a transparent, open and competitive process.
3.20.4 Description of the steps taken
MEF Direzione IV indicated that MEF Direzione VII will be responsible for compliance with the
Commitment. MEF Direzione IV is not aware that the Italian State owns stakes in other banks (CDP is
not a bank). The MEF Direzione IV has provided the Monitoring Trustee with the relevant contacts at
MEF Direzione VII to follow up on the Commitment.
As of today, MEF Direzione VII mentions that the Commitment 20 is fully respected by Italian
Government.
Italian State indirectly owns a 5.4% stake in Banca Carige via S.G.A. Spa which acquired the stake in
the context of its ordinary activity, as investment helpful for NPL management, that is the core
business of SGA.
This is a minority stake, so that Italian Government doesn’t have the indirect control of Carige: SGA
doesn’t manage the Bank and doesn’t have any confidential information from the Bank and doesn’t
exercise any influence on Carige.
As a consequence, the banks in which Italian Government has participations (BMPS and Carige) are
separate economic units with independent powers of decision.
                                                                                                        89

trading
3.22.2 List of issues arising
No issue to report to date
Point of attention: The monthly stop loss limit has been exceeded on the 29th of May (monthly Loss
reached the level of €-61m vs. the current threshold set at €-31m), then the Loss remained over the
limit in the two following days (though receding to €-58m on May 30 and to €-32.9m on May 31). The
upsurge of the metric was caused by the sudden fall of Italian Government Bonds prices, that hit the
relatively low risk (short term) positions held mainly for market making purposes, causing most of
the Loss recorded for the Proprietary Trading portfolio. Given that the loss was stemming from
government bonds i.e. prima facie least risky instruments and presumably temporary nature of the
loss i.e. that it decreased to almost the committed level at the end of May, EC DG Comp has agreed
to overlook once this breach.
3.22.3 Description of the commitment (A22)
    a) Under no circumstances will the Bank carry out trading activities that will significantly
          increase the risk profile of the Bank. Specifically, the value at risk for market price changes of
          the overall trading portfolio (i.e. “trading book” as defined per article 4.1.86 of the
          Regulation (EU) no 575/2013 of the European parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013
          on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms will not exceed Euro
          20.0 million/daily and Euro 14.4 million/daily average, 99% confidence, where “daily
          average” means the daily average on any three-month rolling period. The monthly stop loss
          limit on proprietary trading is set at Euro 31 million.
    b) The Bank's proprietary trading will be limited to liquid instruments. Liquid instruments are
          those with reliable quotes provided by a reasonable number of market participants (i.e.
          minimum 5) and that can be traded with small transaction costs (i.e. maximum bid / ask
          spread of 5% of notional).
    c) A list of liquid instruments on which the Bank will be allowed to continue trading in the
          future under this commitment is set out in the Appendix B to this List of Commitments. The
          Bank may trade in those instruments provided that traded products are allowed only to the
          extent that their underlying reflects the aforementioned liquidity requirements under all
          circumstances. In addition, the Bank will not hold positions in instruments which are not in
          the scope of the Bank’s ordinary course of business or on derivatives having exotic
          underlying. Instruments traded will only feature a single layer of optionality (i.e. no
          derivatives on derivatives (with the exception of swaptions) / structured products).
    d) The Bank may ask for a revision of Value at Risk (VaR) and stop loss limit on proprietary
          trading in case of significant changes in market conditions. A change in market conditions is
          considered occurring when one of the conditions set below is met: (i) the value of the
                                                                                                          91

                                                                                          6-Aug-18
        Eurostoxx 50 equity index changes by more than 10 per cent in a period of ten working days;
        (ii) the yield offered by the Buoni Ordinari del Tesoro with 6 months maturity changes by
        more than 100 basis points over a period of ten working days; (iii) the volatility of Euro
        interest rates, measured by the means of swaptions price on a 10 Fix for Variable Interest
        Rate Swap, increases by more than 10 per cent in a period of ten working days. In this case,
        the Monitoring Trustee will assess the Bank’s request and provide a comprehensive report
        that will be submitted for endorsement of Commission’s services.
3.22.4 Description of the steps taken
a) i-VAR limit
BMPS represents, as illustrated in the table below, that the VaR for market change in the overall
trading portfolio did not exceed €20m Euro/daily. BMPS also represented that the Euro 14.4
million/daily average for a 3m rolling period as defined in the Commitment was not exceeded.
The Market Value of the Trading Book portfolio was:
     - €5.2m on December 2016
     - €6.5m on March 2017
     - €5.4m on June 2017

The Average VaR for market change in the overall trading portfolio did not exceed €14.4mln

daily average on a three-month rolling period

a) iii-Monthly Stop loss limit
The monthly stop loss limit has been exceeded on the 29th of May (monthly Loss reached the level of
€-61m vs. the current threshold set at €-31m), then the Loss remained over the limit in the two
following days (though receding to €-58m on May 30 and to €-32.9m on May 31).
The upsurge of the metric was caused by the sudden fall of Italian Government Bonds prices, that hit
the relatively low risk (short term) positions held mainly for market making purposes, causing most
of the Loss recorded for the Proprietary Trading portfolio. The main driver of the aforementioned
loss recorded is the MPSCS desk which holds Italian Government Bonds (Government Bond).
Given that the loss is stemming from government bonds i.e. prima facie least risky instruments and
presumably temporary nature of the loss i.e. that it decreased to almost the committed level at the
end of May, EC DG Comp has agreed to overlook once this breach.
Table 3.22.4.b – Group MPS: Monthly Stop Loss Limit
b) and c) Liquid instruments
BMPS represents that they only traded liquid instruments and in the scope of ordinary course of
business as defined in the commitment.
d) Revision of Value at Risk (VaR) and stop loss limit
BMPS did not request a revision of the VaR and stop loss limit to date.
In relation to the possibility provided by Commitment 22) of “asking for a revision of VaR/Stop Loss
Limits, in case of significant changes in market conditions” BMPS reports that Yield variation for BOT
12/14/2018 (6 month approx. of residual maturity) between May, the 16th and May, the 29th (ten
working days span) amounted to about 110bps (exceeding the 100bps threshold provided in the
Commitment. Though the Monthly stop loss has now been reset for the natural end of May (the
metric receded however within the limit in the same day of the reset), BMPS notified (by call and
with the memo) the breach of the limit for two days of May, 30th and 31st, underlining in the
meantime that the abnormal dynamics of market conditions recorded could have allowed BMPS to
ask for a revision of Monthly Stop loss Limit so that no violation would be reported.
In consideration of what reported above, BMPS asks to have the possibility to consider within the
next month the opportunity of a revision of current Stop Loss and VaR limits, should BMPS notice a
persistent modification of volatility regime for the risk factors interested by the recent turbulence,
that could result in an excessive restrain to ordinary Trading activity. Any request of revision should
be made within the guidelines of the Commitment.
                                                                                                     93

Full and proper implementation of all commitments will be continuously and thoroughly monitored
in detail by an independent (of the Republic and the Bank) Monitoring Trustee, that shall neither
have nor become exposed to a conflict of interest and shall possess the necessary qualifications to
carry out its mandate, for example as an investment bank or consultant or auditor, and shall not be
subject to a conflict of interests throughout the exercise of his mandate. The Trustee shall be
remunerated by the Bank in a way that does not impede the independent and effective fulfilment of
its mandate and will be appointed by the Bank following endorsement of the trustee by the
Commission (in line with a separate Agreement). The mandate will end when the restructuring
period finishes.

         Execution:
         The senior A notes’ tranching exceeded Restructuring Plan expectations, which initially
         contemplated a class of Non-Investment Grade notes for approximately €500 million that will
         therefore not be issued. Once GACS are obtained, the senior A notes will have no RWA
         associated hence will not face the limit calculation of large exposures (25% of eligible
                                                                                                     95

GACS, for the foreseeable future.

4.1 BMPS comments on the interpretation of selected commitments for
       reference
Warning: the presentation of BMPS comments on the interpretation of some commitments should
not be considered as an endorsement of BMPS point of view by neither the Monitoring Trustee nor
the EC DG Competition. EC DG Competition as the exclusive ability to provide clarification on the
interpretation of commitments.
4.1.1    Acquisition ban (#2)
Focus on FITD Volontary Scheme
BMPS considers that its contribution of the FITD (Italian deposit guarantee fund) Volontary
Scheme is not optional and that any contribution, including the latest €6.08m (6.4%*€95m) should
not be considered within the cap of the Commitment. BMPS argues that:
<U+F0A7> BMPS contribution to the Voluntary Scheme (“VS”) carried out in H2 2017 was based on a
    mandatory commitment taken in 2016 to which BMPS could not withdraw. It was therefore
    legally binding for BMPS well before the approval of the Restructuring Plan by DG Comp.
<U+F0A7> The support of VS to stabilize the three distressed banks was beneficial to the system: Fondo
    Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (Interbank Deposit Protection Fund “FITD”) should have
    intervened to pay the depositors for the amount protected (estimated at about EUR 2,1bn)
    and BMPS would have had to pay pro rata about EUR 135 million.
<U+F0A7> Following the acquisition by Cariparma of the three banks the capital of the VS was fully used
    for the recovery of the three distressed Italian banks. Consequently the contribution cannot be
    considered an equity stake or an investment but the result of a commitment taken in 2016.
<U+F0A7> Information on the VS for reference
    - The VS is an instrument for the resolution of banking crises created within FITD. Unlike
         FITD, banks can participate to VS on a voluntary basis and its interventions do not
         represent state aids. Decisions on single interventions to make use of the financial
         resources of the Scheme are binding for the participating banks.
    - The VS can initiate interventions in support of participating banks in special administration
         or failing or likely to fail, in accordance with the specific conditions provided for in the
         regulations, as well as interventions for the transfer of assets and liabilities initiated in the
         event of compulsory administrative liquidation.
    - According to the title II of the FITD by-laws, the VS has its own financial resources, set at
         the maximum of EUR 795 million, which the participating banks are committed to provide
         at first request to carry out interventions. If exhausted, the financial resources of the VS
         can be replenished through a decision of a Board Meeting.
    - BMPS joined the VS with most of the Italian banks since it was established, therefore the
         contribution paid by BMPS to the VS during 2017 was mandatory. VS funds have been fully
         deployed for the support of Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini and
         Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato. Without the support of VS to stabilize these banks, FITD
         should have intervened to pay the depositors for the protected amount (estimated at
         about EUR 2.1 billion). In that case, BMPS would have paid about EUR 135 million.
    - According to the FITD by-laws, VS can survive only if banks representing at least 95% of
         total covered deposits (as calculated by FITD on the latest available data, BMPS’s
         percentage was about 6.4%) participate. Consequently, if BMPS retreat from the Scheme,
         VS would be unwound.
    - The amount of the contribution for the endowment of the voluntary arm of FITD is
                                                                                                           97

                                                                                                 6-Aug-18
         determined for every need for intervention on the basis of the amount of the covered
         deposits of each intermediary. The percentage of contribution due by BMPS for the last
         intervention was 6.4%.
    -    During 2016 the voluntary arm of the FITD intervened in the recovery of Cassa di
         Risparmio di Cesena subscribing a capital increase for EUR 280 million.
    -    At the end of September, the voluntary arm of the FITD contributed EUR 470 million to the
         recapitalization of three distressed Italian banks (i.e. Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, Cassa di
         Risparmio di Rimini and Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato) which are being taken over by
         Crédit Agricole Cariparma (for a consideration of EUR 130 million), as well as EUR 170
         million to fund the junior and mezzanine tranches of a securitisation vehicle to which non-
         performing loans of the three target banks are being transferred for balance sheet clean-
         up purposes.
    -    On the 21st of December 2017 Crédit Agricole Cariparma completed the purchase of
         95.3% of the share capital of Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini
         and Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato from the voluntary arm of the FITD. Then at the end
         of 2017 the capital of the voluntary arm of the FITD was fully used for the recovery of the
         three distressed Italian banks and the only assets retained were the notes of the
         securitization.
The Commission has however confirmed that it's position is final: the de minimis amount in future
MT reports will be analysed taking into account the FITD investment.
4.1.2    Remuneration of the Bank's Employees and Managers (#2)
BMPS fully complies with the Commitment but highlights that the current salary cap on managers
without the possibility to introduce incentive mechanisms, creates a retention issue illustrated but
the departure of the previous CFO, M. Francesco Mele.
