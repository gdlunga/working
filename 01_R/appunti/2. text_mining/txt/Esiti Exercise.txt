General Objectives
 The project “Reporting instructions for banks’ internal validation function”
 has been developed by ECB and NCA model experts with the following goals:
     1. Ensuring robust information on all models in the SSM and improving
          prioritisation of supervisory assessments
     2. Defining common metrics for the assessment of internal models across SSM
     3. Promoting a common reporting of institutions' validation results towards the ECB
       The standardized reporting neither replaces the institutions' own validation nor
       does it intend to promote best practices in the validation of internal models. It is the
       responsibility of each institution to define its appropriate internal validation framework

Pilot phase (2/2)
 The data submitted during the pilot phase have been quality assured by the
 ECB and then used to:
     1. Review the set of tests in order to enhance the outcomes of the analyses
         (introducing / removing tests whenever deemed appropriate)
     2. Clarify the documentation in order to facilitate the implementation of tests and
         the interpretation of the results
     3. Calibrate thresholds for statistical tests in order to appropriately identify
         warnings about performances of AMA models and to ease results interpretation
     4. Get a comprehensive picture of the performance of AMA models in order to
         support a smooth the transition towards the new envisaged Basel framework

       modeling of both frequency and severity of losses based on data from the pilot phase
