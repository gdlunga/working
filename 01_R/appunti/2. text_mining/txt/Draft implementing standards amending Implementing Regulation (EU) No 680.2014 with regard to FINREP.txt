2. Executive Summary
1. Non-performing exposures are one of the key priorities for supervisors and one of the biggest
   challenges faced by many institutions across Europe. High NPE levels ultimately have a negative
   impact on institutions’ profitability, solvency and consequently lending capacity to the overall
   economy.
2. The European Council published in July 2017 its Action plan to tackle NPLs in Europe. The EBA
   was invited by the Council to contribute to this Action Plan with a number of initiatives and
   action points, in particular in the area of supervision and development of secondary markets for
   distressed assets. Among others, the EBA was asked to issue guidelines on the management of
   non-performing loans (NPLs).
3. This planned revision to Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 includes suggestions on the reporting on
   non-performing and forborne exposures that is key to assess institutions’ strategy on the
   management of NPLs as well as the overall effectiveness of these strategies. At a more general
   level, this proposal for changes to the ITS on Supervisory Reporting aims at strengthening
   supervisors’ ability to assess and monitor non-performing portfolios by way of collecting more
   granular information on these assets on a recurring basis and thereby close identified data gaps.
4. In order to be proportionate, the amended reporting requirements envisage two
   complementary ‘modules’. Module 1 covers revisions to existing templates, introducing
   additional breakdowns on performing and non-performing exposures, forborne exposures and
   collateral obtained. Module 2 introduces new templates to provide deeper insights into
   institutions’ NPE portfolios and NPE management strategies and shall be reported only by
   institutions with elevated levels of NPEs that are not ‘small and non-complex’.
5. The envisaged amendments to the ITS on Supervisory Reporting also concern the reporting on
   profit or loss items in FINREP. Expenses play a crucial role in institutions’ performance, but are,
   compared to institutions’ income, asymmetrically represented in the current reporting
   framework. Given their prominent role for the EU banking sector, amendments to FINREP
   targeted at improving the insights especially into operating and administrative expenses are
   proposed. Furthermore, the information collected on fee and commission income and expenses
   is revised to reflect so far unrepresented sources of income and expenses.
6. From 1st January 2019 onwards, IFRS 16 Leases (‘IFRS 16’) replaces IAS 17 as the new standard
   for the accounting of leases. Under IFRS 16, mainly the accounting of leases by the lessee
   changes: the differentiation between finance and operating leases is removed, assets and
   liabilities are, with limited exceptions, recognised in respect of all leases. Considering the revised
   accounting rules, some minor changes to FINREP are proposed to obtain a complete view of the
   main impacts on lessees’ financial situation and profit or loss.
                                                                                                        4

Next steps
7. After a consultation period of 3 months the EBA will revise the proposal, taking into account the
   feedback received. The submission of the final updated ITS to the EU Commission will take place
   after the consultation and publication of the data-point model, XBRL taxonomy and validation
   rules, probably in April/May 2019. The first reference date for the reporting in accordance with
   the revised version of these technical standards is foreseen to be the 31 March 2020. The
   expected implementation period for the proposed changes is approximately 1 year.
                                                                                                   5

3. Background and rationale
3.1 Revisions to the reporting on non-performing and forborne
exposures (NPE&FBE)
Rationale
8. Non-performing exposures are one of the key priorities for supervisors and one of the biggest
   challenges faced by many institutions across Europe. High NPE levels ultimately have a negative
   impact on institutions’ profitability, solvency and consequently lending capacity to the overall
   economy.
9. The European Council published in July 2017 its Action plan to tackle NPLs in Europe. The Council
   stressed that a comprehensive approach combining a mix of complementing policy actions, at
   national and at the European level where appropriate, is the most effective way to address the
   existing stock of NPEs as well as the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks’ balance
   sheets.
10.The EBA, along with other bodies and institutions, was invited by the Council to contribute to this
   Action Plan with a number of initiatives and action points, in particular in the area of supervision
   and development of secondary markets for distressed assets. Among others, the EBA was asked to
   issue guidelines on the management of non-performing loans (NPLs).
11.This planned revision to Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 includes suggestions on the reporting on non-
   performing and forborne exposures, such as detailed data on changes to the stock of NPLs (inflows
   / outflows) as well as more comprehensive information on provisioning. This information is key to
   assess institutions’ strategy on the management of NPLs as well as the overall effectiveness of these
   strategies, shedding light on measures available at the different points of the lifecycle of an
   exposure, such as the granting of forbearance measures or closure actions like collateral
   liquidations, the sale of non-performing portfolios etc.
12.At a more general level, this proposal for changes to the ITS on Supervisory Reporting aims at
   strengthening supervisors’ ability to assess and monitor non-performing portfolios by way of
   collecting more granular information on these assets on a recurring basis and thereby close
   identified data gaps. It benefits from experience of competent authorities on the supervision of
   institutions with significant NPE portfolios.
Main features of the proposal
13.The amended reporting requirements envisage two complementary ‘modules’. Module 1 covers
   revisions to existing templates, introducing additional breakdowns on performing and non-
   performing exposures, forborne exposures and collateral obtained (mainly templates 13, 18 and
                                                                                                       6

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
   19). Module 2 introduces new templates (templates 23 to 26 and 47) to provide deeper insights
   into institutions’ NPE portfolios and NPE management strategies.
Module 1
14.Module 1 comprises the following new, revised or enhanced elements:
    •    New information on commercial real estate (CRE) exposures as well as new information on
         exposures secured by immovable property by level of collateralisation;
    •    Enhanced and new information on performing exposures, NPEs and FBEs toward selected
         counterparty types (SMEs, households);
    •    Enhanced and new information on performing exposures and NPEs, broken down by IFRS 9
         impairment stages, in order to monitor the connection between performance status and
         accounting treatment;
    •    New information on inflows into and outflows from the NPE portfolio, targeted at capturing
         the dynamics of the development of institutions’ NPE portfolio;
    •    Minor revision of the ‘days past due’ buckets in the NPE template, in order to facilitate the
         close monitoring of the gradual provisioning of different types of NPEs;
    •    Enhanced information on collateral and guarantees received (more granular breakdowns by
         type of collateral and guarantees received, information on value changes since recognition).
15.Module 1 supports the monitoring of the specific risks born by commercial real estate (CRE) loans
   (i.e. exposures to real estate developers and the income producing real estates) as a portfolio where
   particular scrutiny is expected from the supervisors in accordance with the Recommendation of the
   European Systemic Risk Board on closing real estate data gaps (ESRB/2016/14). In addition,
   information on exposures secured by immovable property with a high LTV ratio is collected to gain
   insights into exposures with a potentially insufficient collateral coverage.
16.The revisions to the templates on non-performing and forborne exposures close a data gap
   identified with regard to exposures to SMEs as a type of counterparty of particular interest from an
   economic perspective.
17.The request for more granular information on different collateral types aims at gaining a
   comprehensive view on the coverage of different sub-portfolios in terms of collateral and financial
   guarantees and deeper insights into the use of collaterals with different liquidity levels. The
   information on collateral obtained by taking possession provides an indication of an institution’s
   foreclosure management and, considering the transformation of a non-performing exposure to an
   asset obtained by taking possession as an additional step in the credit cycle, of an institution’s
   strategy for dealing with non-performing assets in a broader sense.
Module 2
                                                                                                       7

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
18.Module 2 complements Module 1 by introducing new templates with information that provides
   further insights into an institutions’ portfolios of performing and non-performing loans and
   advances (NPL), forborne loans and advances (FBL) and on collateral obtained, such as
    •   Exposures in (pre-)litigation status, exposures with a very high coverage in terms of
        impairments etc. or accumulated partial write-offs;
    •   Drivers for inflows into or outflows from the NPL portfolio, flow of impairments and write-offs,
    •   Collateral in- and outflows, information on vintage of the collateral (recognition in the balance
        sheet) or
    •   More granular information on the forbearance management and quality of forbearance.
19.The complementary information on performing and non-performing as well as forborne exposures
   is requested with a breakdown by exposures to households and to non-financial corporations, and,
   occasionally, to SMEs, in order to take account of the peculiarities in exposures to these
   counterparties. Considering the low or very low relevance of market-based funding both for SMEs
   and households in most EU countries, only information on loans and advances is requested with
   this additional breakdown.
20.Exposures in litigation or pre-litigation status are singled out in the revised reporting requirement,
   because they are managed differently from other exposures within institutions, i.e. they are
   transferred either internally to legal departments or externally to legal firms.
21.Information is also requested on items reflecting provisioning policies as well as write-offs to
   understand and evaluate institutions’ practices and strategies with regard to the management of
   loans with a heightened credit risk.
22.The aim of collecting more granular information on inflows and outflows from the NPL portfolio is
   to understand the key drivers for the development of the NPL portfolio in the respective accounting
   year.
23.Foreclosure may be one of the means chosen by institutions to deal with and reduce the level of
   non-performing exposures. Where the collateral obtained is included in institutions’ balance
   sheets, it may become a relevant source of credit risk. Therefore, supervisors need to have a clear
   view on the level of foreclosed assets in institutions’ as well as their composition, development in
   terms of value, liquidity and accounting policies applied (cancelled loan amounts, gross foreclosed
   asset values, provisioning, asset types and vintages), in order to understand, and assess the
   effectiveness of institutions’ strategies in the area of collateral obtained by taking possession.
24.Forbearance measures aim at fostering the return of less well performing exposures into a situation
   of sustainable repayment. Considering the variety of potential measures to improve or reinstate
   obligors’ capacity to pay, the forbearance measures applied by institutions deserve a closer
   monitoring, in order to understand to which extent the envisaged goals are achieved.
                                                                                                        8

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
25.Loans and advances measured at cost or amortised costs account for the vast majority of non-
    performing exposures. However, IFRS 9 may entail the classification of certain loans and advances
    into fair value categories (i.e. fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value
    through profit and loss (FVPnL)). For this reason and because loans and advances accounted for at
    fair value are of particular relevance in certain Member States, the revised reporting requirements
    also cover, with a few exceptions, fair value portfolios.
Proportionality
26.NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at micro prudential level, heightened NPEs are associated
    with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macro prudential level, high levels of NPEs are
    connected to stagnant growth as capital is tied up with NPEs and decreased new lending into the
    real economy. In addition, a high stock of NPEs negatively affect the resilience of the banking sector
    to shocks and hence increases systemic risk. All of these effects must be tackled in a comprehensive
    manner. Against this background, relevant information on NPEs needs to be collected and relevant
    data needs to be monitored from as many institutions as possible with an appropriate level of
    granularity. On the other hand, the burden the reporting requirement implies for institutions has
    to be duly considered.
27.In order to introduce proportionality, this revised reporting requirement is structured around two
    complementary modules. Module 1 addresses the key reporting elements on NPEs, FBEs and
    collateral obtained which are relevant for all institutions. Module 2 aims at enabling a close
    monitoring of the NPE strategy of reporting institutions having material NPL and FBL portfolios. It
    is consequently be proposed to request it only from institutions with elevated levels of NPEs,
    measured as an NPL ratio of 5% or above. The threshold of 5% 1 aligns the reporting criteria with
    the criteria used in the draft EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne
    exposures to identify institutions which should set an NPE strategy and related operational and
    governance aspects 2 and the draft EBA Guidelines on disclosure of non-performing and forborne
    exposures.
28.NPEs are of particular relevance not only for significant institutions, but also for less significant ones,
    especially when concentrated in one particular market or jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the sizeable
    reporting burden inherent to Module 2 is acknowledged; in order to balance the benefits and the
    burden, it is planned to request Module 2 only from institutions that do not qualify as ‘small and
    non-complex institutions’. The definition of ‘small and less complex’ institutions will be aligned with
    the definition proposed in the amendments to the Capital Requirement Regulation (draft CRR 2).
Fostering the consistency between reporting and disclosure requirements
29.The information included in the reporting framework is the basis for supervisors to form a clear
    picture on the situation of an institution in terms of business model / profitability, solvency / risk
1
  The NPL ratio is the ratio between the gross carrying amount of non-performing loans and advances and the total gross
carrying amount of loans and advances subject to the definition of non-performing exposures as presented in section 17 of
Part 2 of Annex V of this Regulation. For the purpose of this calculation, loans and advances classified as held for sale, cash
balances at central banks and other demand deposits shall be excluded both from the denominator and the numerator.

   profile, liquidity and relevance for the financial system. Similarly, the information disclosed by
   institutions is the basis for market participants to understand and assess the institutions’ situation
   in order to exercise market discipline. Information relevant for market participants should be
   equally relevant for supervisors.
30.Against this background, the reporting requirements are designed, bearing in mind the disclosure
   requirements and vice versa. Improving the consistency between the reporting and disclosure
   requirements, including a standardisation of formats and definitions, should also increase the
   efficiency and reduce the burden both with regard to institutions’ reporting and disclosure
   obligations, and therefore facilitate the compliance with both.
Examples for the reporting in selected templates
Examples on template F 25.01 (collateral obtained by taking possession other than collateral
classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E) - inflows and outflows)
Example 1
Obtaining possession of the collateral (31 December 2017)
31.The reporting institution has in on its balance sheet an NPL with a gross carrying amount of CU 100
   (A). Based on the estimate for the discounted expected cash flows from a potential liquidation of
   the collateral provided by the debtor, the institution books an accumulated impairment of CU 20
   (B).
32.The NPL is secured by a single type of collateral, which the institution obtains in November 2017
   and recognises in its balance sheet with a value CU 70 (C).
33.At point in time of obtaining possession of the collateral, the part of the NPL not covered by the
   collateral obtained (CU 30) is considered uncollectible by the institution and derecognised (write-
   off of CU 10 + use of previously booked impairment of CU 20) (D).

Obtaining possession of the collateral (31 March 2018)
40.In March 2018, the reporting institution has on its balance sheet an NPL with a gross carrying
   amount of CU 100 (A), for which an accumulated impairment of CU 20 is booked (B).
41.The NPL is secured by a single type of collateral, which the institution obtains on 31 March 2018.
   The collateral has a value of 70 (C) at that date. CU 70 of the loan are de-recognised in exchange of
   the recognition of the repossessed collateral.
42.As the institution still expects at least CU 10 to be recoverable from the borrower, the loan’s
   remaining gross carrying amount of CU 30 (D) is not derecognised on 31 March 2018 and therefore
   not reported as a debt balance reduction.

Additional write-offs (30 June 2018)
43.On 15 April 2018 the institution books an additional impairment of CU 10, not expecting anymore
   a payment from the borrower. Later that month, it decides to derecognise the remaining CU 30 of
   the loan as it considers them uncollectible.
44.The data reported in template F 25.01 remains exactly the same as the one reported in March.
Examples on the F 24-templates (Flows of non performing exposures, impairment & write
offs since the end of the last financial year - loans and advances)
Example 3 – Inflows and outflow from the NPE portfolio
45.On 1 October 2015, the institution has an exposure (loan) to a counterparty with a gross carrying
   amount of CU 100 that is partially secured by a portfolio of securities (expected to be worth CU 65).
   This loan becomes non-performing in December 2015 and a forbearance measure is applied. By the
   end of June 2017, it meets the conditions for being reclassified as performing forborne under
   probation (A).
46.On 2 January 2018, the loan becomes non-performing again (B).
47.On 30 March 2018, the institution takes possession of the collateral, now valued at CU 50 (D). In
   this moment, it recognises a partial write-off of CU 15 (E). The institutions still expects a cash
   recovery from the loan’s unsecured part (CU 35).
48.Because of a further deterioration of the debtor’s financial situation, the remaining CU 35 of the
   NPL are completely written off in September 2018 (F). The institution forgives the debt (G).
49.The following information is reported in template F 24.01 as of 30 September 2018:

Example 4 – Write-offs and debt forgiveness
52.Case A: An NPL of CU 100 is fully written-off on 30 October 2018. The Right to recover is legally
    forfeited on 30 March 2019 with regard to CU 70 of the loan, but for the remaining CU 30 the right
    to recover is kept.
53.Case B: An NPL of CU 100 is written-off on 30 October 2018 by 70% (CU 70). The right to recover is
    legally forfeited on 30 March 2019 with regard to the full loan amount (CU 100) and therefore CU 30
    are written-off at the moment of forfeiture.
54.Case C: On 31 January 2019, the right to recover an NPL of CU 100 was legally forfeited with regard
    to 60% of the loan (60 CUs), and for the remaining 40 the right to recover was kept. On 31 March
    another CU 10 are written-off, assuming they will not be repaid. However, these CU 10 are not
    forfeited.

3.2 Improvements to the reporting on profit or loss items (P&L)
57.As analyses conducted on institutions’ profitability and business models by supervisory and other
   authorities frequently show, expenses play a crucial role in institutions’ performance. Additional
   information on certain types of expenses also provide some insights on institutions’ governance.
58.Given their prominent role for the EU banking sector, a review of the level of information available
   on expenses inside the reporting framework is necessary, considering that income and expenses
   are currently asymmetrically represented. Amendments to FINREP provide meaningful insights into
   the issue by improving the level of detail provided especially on operating and administrative
   expenses.
59.The planned revisions to the reporting on profit or loss items cover the following main elements:
    •   Additional information on administrative expenses, such as staff expenses and IT expenses;
    •   Revisions to the reporting on fee and commission income and expenses;
    •   Additional information related to profitability indicators; as well as
    •   Minor amendments to reflect contributions to resolution funds and interest income / expenses
        on selected exposure types.
60. Staff expenses account for roughly half of an institution’s expenses and other administrative
   expenses are the second biggest block. Given that the management and reduction of costs has been
   a focus of institutions in the recent years, it is important to understand better what drives these
   expenses.
61.The revised reporting requirements capture staff expenses by structure and category of staff
   respectively nature of the remuneration, whereby, in the latter case, concepts presented in
   Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 (RTS on criteria to identify categories of staff whose professional
   activities have a material impact on an institution’s risk profile ) are widely re-used and the
   reporting requirements are aligned to the extent possible with the reporting requirement defined
   in EBA/GL/2014/08 (Guideline on the remuneration benchmarking exercise).
62.Information is requested on ‘Information Technology expenses’ as sub-category of other
   administrative expenses. IT expenses, understood as expenses to deliver IT-enabled business
   processes, application services and infrastructure solutions for business outcomes, have been
   identified in recent analyses as material and significant among the other administrative expenses.
63.Under the current FINREP instructions, the majority of the fee and commission income and
   expenses are reported as ‘other’ fee and commission income. Some discussions suggest that
   especially fee and commission income in the retail business (e.g. fees for management of current
   account, fees on loans granted), card fee incomes and fees generated through corporate finance
   activities (e.g. M&A, treasury management) as well as fee and commission expenses related to the
   distribution of institutions’ products via external agent networks or loan brokers are currently
                                                                                                    16

   unrepresented, but warrant closer monitoring. Apart from this, the proposed revised reporting
   requirements envisage an alignment of the breakdowns for fee and commission income and
   expenses.
64.In addition to the financial information, a few information items are proposed for collection that
   reflect the main external factors affecting institutions’ cost structure and allow further insights into
   the distribution channels of institutions, such as the number of employees and the number of
   branches which are key cost drivers for institutions. Additionally, it is also relevant to assess
   institutions’ responses to non-bank competition, most notably from FinTechs in light of the
   increasing digitalisation of banking. These new items, although different in nature from other
   FINREP information, are nevertheless often published by institutions in their financial reports.
3.3 Changes to FINREP with regard to IFRS 16
65.From 1st January 2019 onwards, IFRS 16 Leases (‘IFRS 16’) replaces IAS 17 as the new standard for
   the accounting of leases. Under IFRS 16, mainly the accounting of leases by the lessee changes: the
   differentiation between finance and operating leases is removed, assets and liabilities are, with
   limited exceptions, recognised in respect of all leases. Considering the revised accounting rules,
   some minor changes to FINREP are proposed to obtain a complete view of the main impacts on
   lessees’ financial situation and profit or loss.
                                                                                                         17

(5)       Institutions’ risk profile and profitability are be affected by high level of non-

          impact on institutions’ profitability, solvency and consequently lending capacity to
          the overall economy. Revisions to the reporting requirements that strengthen the
          ability of competent authorities to assess and monitor non-performing portfolios by
          way of collecting more granular information on these assets on a recurring basis and
          thereby close identified data gaps are necessary.

(6)       The performance of institutions in the EU, both in terms of profitability and
          sustainability of business models, is influenced significantly by the structure and
          extent of their expenses. In order to ensure that competent authorities gain deeper
          insights into those, the reporting framework needs to be improved.

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
5. Accompanying documents
5.1 Draft cost-benefit analysis / impact assessment
As per Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (EBA Regulation), any guidelines and
recommendations developed by the EBA shall be accompanied by an Impact Assessment (IA) which
analyses ‘the potential related costs and benefits’.
The analysis presented in this section focuses on the implications of recent developments in the
banking sector as well as the revisions to the regulatory framework for the specific FINREP
templates described in the consultation paper above. The three main topics with implications on
reporting templates are (i) continued attention placed on the level of NPLs in Europe, (ii) specific
supervisory observations of recent studies with respect to P&L items (e.g. the analysis by
competent authorities on profitability and business models), (iii) the applicability of IFRS 16 from
January 2019. The analysis that follows will be structured along these three main topics. Given the
nature and the scope of the revisions, the IA is high-level and mainly qualitative in nature.
Revisions to the reporting on Non-performing and forborne exposures (NPE&FBE)
A. Problem identification
NPEs remain one of the key challenges of Europe’s banking sector. Whilst improvements have been
observed over recent years, progress is slow and in particular remains very heterogeneous across
countries. Bank funding continues to take prominence in the European funding market and EU
banks are still heavily reliant on net interest income. This further places asset quality and credit risk
at the centre of EU banks’ business models. The effects of high levels of NPEs in bank balance sheets
on funding costs, capital and efficiency (among other things), can seriously jeopardise institutions’
ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.
Recognising the importance and priority of this topic for the EU banking market, several initiatives
have been launched, at European level as well as by individual competent authorities to addressing
the problem of NPEs. The European Council’s Action Plan to tackle NPLs, published in July 2017,
envisages the EBA to contribute to the action plan, inter alia by developing Guidelines on NPL
management consistent with the ECB’s Guidance to institutions on non-performing loans from
March 2017. In the spirit of the Council Action Plan and keeping up with the general developments,
there is a need to improve also the supervisory reporting on NPEs.
Monitoring developments in institutions’ NPE levels is crucial. In order to achieve improvements
and sustainable levels in the long term it is important to be able to assess and monitor
developments better and at a more granular level. This would also contribute to developing a better
understanding of which NPE strategies and practices are effective and working. Improving
consistency and granularity in NPE reporting would be a big step towards improved monitoring and
                                                                                                      24

enabling informed policy decisions. Therefore, it is key to address inconsistencies in NPE
management and reporting and achieve a better way of monitoring developments.
B. Policy objectives
The proposed revised FINREP templates, by significantly improving the information available on
NPEs, addressing the data gaps identified and harmonising the information reported, aim to
strengthen supervisors’ ability to assess and monitor non-performing portfolios.
In order to be proportionate, the proposal is structured around two complementary modules.
Module 1 envisages revisions to existing reporting templates (mainly tables 13, 18 and 19), in order
to inter alia gain more detailed insights into exposures to certain sub-sectors and LTV levels. Module
2 introduces new templates (tables 23 to 26 and 47), proposing additional, even more granular
reporting for institutions with higher NPE levels.
C. Options considered
Section C. under each topic presents the main policy options discussed and the decisions made
during the development of the updated templates for each of the three topics, respectively.
Advantages and disadvantages, as well as potential costs and benefits of the policy options and the
preferred options resulting from this analysis are also reported.
(1) Status quo/ intervention
Option 1a: Keep the current level of detail of the NPE related FINREP templates.
Option 1b: Improve the level of information and granularity in the NPE related FINREP templates.
(2) Proportionality in Module 2
Option 2a: Module 2 templates to be filled in by all institutions.
Option 2b: Module 2 templates to be filled in only by institutions with material NPE portfolios
(>5%).
Option 2c: Introduce further proportionality by requesting Module 2 to be filled in only by
significant institutions with material NPE portfolios (>5%).
Option 2d: Introduce further proportionality by requesting Module 2 to be filled in by all
institutions with material NPE portfolios (>5%) with the exception of small and non-complex
institutions.
(3) Additional granularity – Fair valued items in Module 2
Option 3a: Report only loans and advances at cost and amortised cost (Module 2).
                                                                                                   25

Option 3b: Add also the reporting of loans and advances at fair value (excluding loans and advances
classified as held for trading, trading financial assets and items held for sale) (Module 2).
D. Assessment of the options and preferred options
(i) Status quo / intervention
Detailed, harmonised monitoring is crucial in order to provide supervisors with the necessary
information to promote a sustainable NPE management and sustainable long-term NPE levels
across the EU.
The guidance and (reporting) framework put in place on NPEs over the last years has already been
a big step forward. In 2014, common definitions of NPE and forborne exposures (FBE) were
introduced to facilitate the identification of problematic assets. The reported data allows detailed
insights into, for example, NPEs by exposure classes and geographical location. In 2017 and outside
the supervisory reporting framework, the EBA published standardised templates providing a
common EU data set for the screening, financial due diligence and valuation during NPL
transactions, providing data at the most granular level, including information on counterparties
related to the loan and the collateral provided.
Other guidance and products include the EBA Report on the dynamics and drivers of non-
performing exposures in the EU banking sector, the EBA Report on Statutory Prudential Backstops,
the Consultation Paper on the Draft Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne
exposures and the recently issues Consultation Paper on the Draft Guidelines on disclosure of non-
performing and forborne exposures. All of this has already resulted in a major improvement of
transparency and market certainty, as well as a reduction in information asymmetries.
Given the relevance of the NPE issue for the banking sector, more information is needed and the
reporting requirements need to be adjusted accordingly. The current reporting framework does
not present sufficient details on NPEs to monitor developments effectively, especially more details
on specific vulnerable portfolios (e.g. exposures to particular sectors or exposures with certain LTV
levels) as proposed would be useful.
The revised templates proposed in the CP above in particular envisage more granular information
on:
     •   Various sub-sectors and sub-types of exposures (such as SMEs, CRE exposures);
     •   Level of collateralisation (differentiation between high versus low LTVs);
     •   Collateral and financial guarantees (e.g. breakdown by collateral type);
     •   NPL inflows and outflows.
                                                                                                   26

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
Collecting more granular information on the performance of exposures to various sub-sectors or of
specific sub-types of exposures, in particular on those which tend to be more risky and where
particular scrutiny is appropriate, would allow recognising trends and identifying vulnerabilities
(early on). Having a detailed understanding of the performance of loans in sub-segments is crucial
to better apprehend the vulnerabilities and address any NPE problems in the long term, for example
by allowing targeted policies or promote changes in institutions’ activities in specific sectors.
Likewise, LTV levels are an important indicator of the riskiness of a loan and in the presence of the
low interest rate environment and house price developments in some countries over recent years,
LTV ratios as a macroprudential instrument have been the subject of many policy discussions.
Having more detailed information on the distribution of LTVs across institutions’ portfolios would
inter alia allow a much better assessment of institutions’ risk appetite in their lending decision and
of vulnerabilities of specific borrower types. Moreover, it would also inform policy debates, which
ultimately imply more targeted and more effective outcomes at the system level and for the real
economy.
Monitoring inflows versus outflows is crucial to assessing key drivers of NPEs, as well as institutions’
strategies and their effectiveness. In particular, specifically reporting on NPL inflows in the last 24
months allows an insight into recently granted loans and hence potentially also into changes in
institutions’ lending behaviour over time.
Whilst recognising the additional reporting burden that these proposed revisions would imply for
institutions, most of the information should be expected to be readily available at institutions and
should in fact be assumed to be part (to a certain extent) of their regular internal risk monitoring.
Adding it to the supervisory reporting increases the reporting cost for institutions initially; however,
in the long-run, the data collected can contribute to significantly increasing the understanding of
the NPL landscape by both institutions and supervisors, and thereby notably contribute to
addressing the problems of NPEs in the EU banking sector.
Therefore, Option 1b – to improve the level of granularity collected in the relevant FINREP
templates, is superior to option 1a.
(ii) Proportionality in Module 2
Module 2, as described in the background complements Module 1 and explains some of the
exposures and developments reflected in Module 1 in even more detail, for example with regard
to the NPL inflows and outflows or information on collateral obtained by taking possessions.
Considering the additional level of granularity added in Module 2, special attention with regard to
the issue of proportionality is warranted. Generally speaking, and given that NPEs present a
problem both at the micro-prudential level for the individual institution and the macro-prudential
level for the financial system as a whole, relevant information needs to be collected and relevant
data needs to be monitored from as many institutions as possible with an appropriate level of
granularity. Nevertheless, this objective of obtaining the maximum feasible scope and amount of
data needs to be assessed in consideration of the level of granularity of reporting information at
                                                                                                     27

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
hand, as well as the reporting burden it implies for institutions. In view of this, given the level of
granularity included in Module 2, it is assessed that it would be disproportionate to request Module
2 data from all reporting institutions.
Therefore, Option 2a is ruled out. Instead, three options are considered for applying proportionality
in Module 2:
Under Option 2b the most granular information is proposed to be asked only from those
institutions demonstrating weaker portfolios. Module 2 is to be completed only by institutions with
an NPL ratio of 5% or above. The threshold of 5% has been chosen to align the reporting criteria
with criteria used in the draft EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne
exposures to identify institutions which should set an NPE strategy and related operational and
governance aspects 7.
Requesting very detailed data may in particular overburden smaller institutions. It could therefore
be argued that even more proportionality should be introduced in the reporting of Module 2, by
further limiting it to only significant institutions with higher NPE levels.
Therefore, an additional option, introducing further proportionality is considered:
Option 2c introduces an additional proportionality factor, proposing Module 2 to be filled in only
by significant institutions with an NPL ratio of 5% or above.
Differentiating between size- versus risk- based proportionality is important in the context of NPEs.
An institution’s level of risk, that is its level of NPEs, should arguably be the determining factor to
assess if additional, more granular reporting is appropriate, not least because the NPE level will
govern the actions and NPE strategies necessary within an institution. Substantial NPE problems
can exist regardless of an institution’s size. In particular, analysis conducted as part of the impact
assessment on the Consultation Paper on the Draft Guidelines on management of non-performing
and forborne exposures showed that on average the issue of NPEs is more pronounced amongst
smaller and medium-sized banks (in terms of their volume of total assets and the level of cross-
border activities). With the focus of the proposed new reporting templates on the performance of
EU banks exposures and therefore risks, focusing only on significant institutions would therefore
be too restrictive in determining reporting requirements and risk would no longer be the main
driving factor.
Further, in order to form a complete picture and assess the extent (and potential) risk of NPEs to
the banking sector, including also less significant institutions into the reporting is necessary. For
instance, many less significant institutions may show a very high level of NPEs, which, especially
when concentrated in one particular market or jurisdiction, could imply substantial risks to financial
stability and have broader economic consequences.

Therefore it is viewed as crucial and most effective to include more than significant only institutions
with NPE levels > 5%. Taking into account the sizable reporting burden Module 2 will imply for very
small institutions, however, a compromise Option 2d is proposed. The latter foresees reporting of
Module 2 by all but small banks with NPE levels > 5%.
It is assessed that granting some proportionality by size of institutions but at the same time not
limiting the reporting to significant institutions but allowing risk to be a key determining factor for
reporting requirements, is the preferred option in terms of cots and benefits. Hence,
proportionality Option 2d is preferred to Option 2b and Option 2c.
(iii) Additional granularity – Fair value
Countries differ in terms of their accounting of loans and advances. If trading activity is low and
there is no active market for loans and advances, the latter will be predominantly accounted for at
cost or amortised cost. However, other countries account for loans and advances mostly at fair
value. In addition, the application of IFRS 9 may entail the accounting of more loans and advances
at fair value than was previously the case under IAS 39.
In order to capture the full picture and allow all countries to report appropriately, adding the
reporting of loans and advances at fair value to the scope of exposures covered by the respective
reporting templates, however without a breakdown by accounting portfolios to contain the
reporting burden, is preferred and hence Option 3b is superior to Option 3a.
Improvements to the reporting on profit or loss items (P&L)
A. Problem identification
Costs play a crucial role in EU institutions’ performance, also once again highlighted by a recent
analysis conducted on European institutions’ profitability and business models by competent
authorities. Given their prominent role for the EU banking sector, a discussion around the level of
information available on costs as part of supervisory reporting is necessary. Because of the
importance in the context of institutions’ business models and profitability, amendments to the
FINREP templates could provide meaningful insights into the issue by improving the level of detail
provided on operating and administrative expenses.
B. Policy objectives
To reflect the importance of the cost factor, amendments to selected P&L templates are proposed,
adding more detail on, amongst other things, operating and administrative expenses and collecting
some information on structural and external factors influencing institutions’ cost structure.
                                                                                                     29

AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
C. Options considered
Status quo/ intervention
Option 4a: Keep the current level of detail of the P&L related FINREP templates.
Option 4b: Improve the level of information and granularity in P&L related FINREP templates.
D. Assessment of the options and preferred options
Status quo/ intervention
Business model sustainability of EU banks is a recurring topic. Today’s environment and the
continued profitability pressure under which institutions remain makes it particularly important for
supervisors to carefully assess this particular area. Business model analysis is a key element also of
the Supervisory Review and Evaluation (SREP) process in the EU, identifying business and strategic
risks and assessing the viability and sustainability of institution’s business models.
In order to understand the latter and better comprehend profitability issues, a better insight into
institutions’ cost structures and drivers is essential. The information on P&L items included in the
current reporting framework does not provide sufficient detail on this. Moreover, the coverage of
cost / expenses versus income is currently very asymmetric in FINREP. For example, a lot more
items are collected on operating income compared to operating expenses.
Additional items to be collected as part of the revised templates presented in the Annexes to this
Consultation paper include additional information on staff expenses and IT expenses as part of the
other administrative expenses, which together account for the biggest share in institution’s
expenses and usually cannot be reduced at short notice. The category ‘other’ in the fee and
commission income is proposed to be refined, in order to better understand institutions’ sources
of income other than interest income and understanding the fee and commission expenses better.
Deeper insights into institutions’ fee and commission income and expenses should in particular
facilitate understanding alternative sources of income and potential risks in terms of profitability.
These additional items would hugely contribute to improving the supervisory understanding of
institutions’ business model and profitability conditions. Therefore, Option 4b – to increase the
granularity of the P&L related FINREP templates- is superior to Option 4a.
Changes to FINREP with regard to IFRS 16

A. Problem identification
IFRS 16 changes the accounting rules for leases, in that operating and financial leases are no longer
differentiated but they are all accounted for in the same way on the part of the lessee. These
changes imply that some of the current reporting items will no longer be fully consistent with the
new accounting rules.
 B. Policy objectives
To address the changes in the accounting rules for lessees, some minor amendments and updates
to selected templates are proposed.
C. Options considered
Status quo/ intervention
Option 5a: Keep the current FINREP templates unchanged.
Option 5b: Change the relevant FINREP templates to reflect changes in the accounting framework.
D. Assessment of the options and preferred options
Status quo/ intervention
Keeping the current templates unchanged would imply that the reporting framework is mis-aligned
with the accounting framework as changes to the accounting rules for lessees would not be
reflected in the templates.
Option 5b, to reflect changes in the accounting framework by slightly amending the respective
FINREP templates, is therefore assessed as superior to Option 5a.
Conclusion (for all)
Based on the above considerations, the benefits of the proposed revisions to the FINREP templates
in the form of improved clarity and granularity on specific balance sheet items and their
development, are assessed to outweigh the costs of additional reporting.

5.2 Overview of questions for consultation
    5.2.1         Questions included in Annex 3 to this Consultation Paper (Annex V to the
         draft ITS)
Question 1 (on template F 02.00)
Do respondents agree with the proposed FINREP representation of “Contributions to resolution
funds and deposit guarantee schemes” as part of “other operating expenses”? If not, which
representation would you suggest?
Question 2 (on templates F 13.2.1 and F 13.3.1)
‘Accumulated negative changes’ tries to capture, in a generic manner and independently from the
type of collateral, the accumulated decrease in the value of a collateral item obtained, where the
value of the collateral decreased since it was obtained by the institution (i.e. cases of increases in
the collateral value are excluded). In this regard, 'accumulated negative changes' captures the net
impact of changes in market prices, impairments and reversals of impairments, write-offs,
depreciation and appreciation, change of accounting policies and similar on the carrying amount of
an individual collateral item, where the difference between the value at initial recognition and
carrying amount, as influenced by this factors, is negative.
The comparison between value at initial recognition and the carrying amount at the reference date
shall be done for each collateral item separately. In order to obtain the aggregate figure that is
reported in the template, only the negative differences shall be aggregated, while cases of positive
differences are to be neglected.
Is this definition clear?
Question 3 (on several templates, see F 18.00)
The ESRB recommendation defines CRE as follows:
‘Commercial real estate’ (CRE) means any income-producing real estate, either existing or under
development, and excludes
(a) social housing;
(b) property owned by end-users;
(c) buy-to-let housing.
If a property has a mixed CRE and RRE use, it should be considered as different properties (based
for example on the surface areas dedicated to each use) whenever it is feasible to make such
breakdown; otherwise, the property ca be classified according to its dominant use.
‘Commercial reals estate (CRE) loan’ means a loan aimed at acquiring a CRE property (or set of
CRE properties) or secured by a CRE property (or set of CRE properties).
                                                                                                   32

‘Income-producing real estate’ means all immovable properties with income generated by their
rents or profits from their sale.
Is this definition clear? To which extent is compatible with, for example, your internal classification?
Which challenges with regard to the practical application of this definition do you envisage?
Question 4 (on several templates, see F 18.00)
The ESRB recommendation defines the current loan-to-value ratio as follows:
‘Current loan-to-value ratio’ (LTV-C) means the sum of all loans or loan tranches secured by the
borrower on a property at the reporting date relative to the current value of the property;
‘Current value of the property’ means the value of the property as assessed by an independent
external or internal appraiser; if such assessment is not available, the current value of the
property can be estimated using a real estate value index sufficiently granular with respect to
geographical location and type of property; if such real estate value index is also not available, a
real estate price index sufficiently granular with respect to geographical location and type of
property can be used after application of a suitably chosen mark-down to account for the
depreciation of the property;
Is this definition clear? Which challenges with regard to the practical application of this definition
do you envisage?
Question 5 (on F 40.01, F 40.02)
The information included in the two group structure templates is currently collected on an annual
basis. Without prejudice to notification obligations under national laws, a more frequent collection
(quarterly) would improve the timely reflection and awareness of changes to institutions’ group
structures. Which benefits and challenges with regard to the compilation and reporting of this
information on a more frequent basis do you envisage?
Question 6 (on F 44.04, F 48.00)
Some of the items included in templates F 44.04 and F 48.00 are also collected for the purposes of
benchmarking in accordance with EBA’s Guideline on the remuneration benchmarking exercise
(EBA/GL/2014/08). The items requested in FINREP are of high-level nature and full alignment has
been sought to keep the reporting burden limited. What is your view on the inclusion of this
information in FINREP? Do you see any inconsistencies between this data and the data collected in
accordance with the GL on remuneration benchmarking exercise that impact the reporting burden?
Question 7 (on several templates, see F 23.01 – F 23.03)
The following templates (templates F 23, F 24, F 26, F 47) request information on loans and
advances subject to definition of non-performing and forborne exposures (with the exception of
loans and advances classified as held for sale), in contrast to F 18 and F 19 that cover ‘exposures’ in
a broader sense, e.g. also debt securities. The rationale behind applying these additional templates
                                                                                                      33

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS
AMENDING IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) NO 680/2014 WITH REGARD TO FINREP
to loans and advances only is that the majority of exposures in credit institutions’ balance sheets
that turned non-performing are loans and advances. To have risk based focus to monitor evolution
of asset quality and to balance reporting burden the templates focus on loans and advances only.
Are the definitions and instructions on the definition of the scope clear?
Question 8 (on F 48.00)
The information collected in this template is different in nature from the information collected in
the remainder of FINREP, i.e. it is mostly of non-financial nature. It is valuable as contextual
information to understand core elements of fixed costs of institutions. Similar information, where
applicable potentially with regard to a different scope of consolidated entities, is collected, for
example, by monetary authorities. Which benefits and challenges with regard to the compilation
and reporting of this information do you envisage?
    5.2.2         Questions included in the text of the draft ITS
Question 9
Are the scope of application of the revised reporting requirements as set out in the draft ITS above,
the reporting templates as set out in Annexes 1 and 2 to this Consultation Paper (Annexes III and
IV to the ITS) and the related instructions in Annex 3 to this Consultation Paper (Annex V to the ITS)
sufficiently clear? In case of uncertainties with regard to scope of entities subject to the reporting
obligation or the information that shall be reported, please provide clear references to the
applicable provision respectively the relevant columns/rows of a given template as well as specific
examples that highlight the need for further clarifications.
