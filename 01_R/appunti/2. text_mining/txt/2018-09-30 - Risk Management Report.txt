Executive Summary – Highlights as at 30-09-2018
 <U+F071> Capital adequacy.
   The Total Capital Ratio still breaches the RAS Tolerance / RPI Amber trigger (13,88% vs 13,94%). The ratio improves w.r.t. end of August
   value (+11 bps) thanks to the implementation of the first RWA reduction actions (+17 bps).
 <U+F071> Liquidity adequacy.
   The NSFR temporary recovers from the Limit breach: the asset reduction in the financial and lending books more than compensate loss of
   funding mainly due to CSEA account.
 <U+F071> Credit Risk
   Significant improvement of the average PD: 2,00% vs 2,09% as of end of August (slide 12). Re-alignment of almost all credit relevant
   parameters, the exception still being Juliet recoveries (slide 15). Relevant metrics reduce the gap with respect to Risk Limits and most are
   expected to recover from the breach by year-end (slide 16).
 <U+F071> Operational Risk
   Mitigation Plan almost completed (slide 21).
 <U+F071> IRRBB
   Breach of the Group Limit due to potential negative impact on NII in case of interest rates decrease, actions under way to rebalance profile
   (slide 26).
 <U+F071> Market Risk
   Significant reduction of Italian sovereign bond holdings, mainly on trading portfolio for around -1,7 bn (slide 27).
                                                                                                                                                3

Section 4 – Operational Inherent Risks
                                                                                          Operational risk losses accounted in the quarter are mainly due to high impact and
                                                                                          low frequency events (Extreme Events), although the total loss is not significant.
                                                                                          In particular the high impact losses recorded (Extreme Events) are primarily related
                                                                                          to the increase of the provision for customer recommendation activity in diamond
                                                                                          investment and for new provisions covering potential reimbursements of mistakes

     The provision relating to the customer recommendation activity for diamond
     purchases increases from 120 €/mln to 125 €/mln; in the quarter, the first
     disbursements for settlement transactions were registered (0,6 €/mln, of which 0,4
     €/mln covered by provision). As at 30 September 2018, nearly 3.700 requests have
     been received for a total value of 116 €/mln.
     Provisions for disputes over past capital increase operations remained stable during
     the quarter.
                                                                                                                                                                               18

Section 4 – Legal Risk
                       As far as Banca MPS as at 30th September 2018 is concerned, with reference to 30th June 2018, litigations remained quite
                       unchanged in terms of number (0%), provision (-2%) and petitum (-1%) of claims:
                       <U+2713> Lawsuits are essentially stable. The main outstanding disputes refer to bankruptcy claw-backs (decreased from the previous
                          quarter: 10 disputes closed, with an overall petitum of approximately 11 €/mln and 1,5 €/mln losses).
                       <U+2713> Tax Litigations have been stable since March 2018.
                       <U+2713> Labor Disputes register a decrease in provision due to a partially favourable pronouncement in a relevant litigation
                          (-3,5€/mln).
                       <U+2713> Complaints remain substantially unaltered in the amount exposed, despite an increase in their number.
                       Finally, Subsidiary companies’ litigations show no significant variation.
                                                                                                                                                    19
