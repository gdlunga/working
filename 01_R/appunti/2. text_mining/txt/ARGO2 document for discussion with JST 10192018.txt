Timeline
 <U+F0FC> Argo 2 Program was set up on 14 January 2016 to address the n. 31 Recommendations formalized by ECB in the letter dated 30
   November 2015 («Follow up Letter On-Site Inspection OSI- 2015-ITMPS-34-35»).
 <U+F0FC> On 6 October 2017 the Bank submitted to ECB the last quarterly update report with the status of the Recommendations as at 30
   June 2017. As of that date Recommendation #31 was ongoing, in accordance with the related road-map, and all the other n. 30
   Recommendations due on 31 December 2016 were completed except for Recommendation #12 and Recommendation #21.
 <U+F0FC> In the document prepared for the Board of Directors’ meeting that will held on 18 October 2018 we state that all the
   Recommendations have been addressed and completed except for Recommendation #31 (due on 31 December 2018), for which
   the related activities are going ahead, with some deliverable being rescheduled.
 <U+F0FC> On 12 October 2018 we received from JST a draft document «OSI 34-35 follow-up and link with OSI 1238» that contains JST
   assessment of the status of the OSI 34-35 recommendations and the link to the new ones from the onsite 1238.
 <U+F0FC> JST’s preliminary assessment is:
   •   Recommendations #30, #31 are still open,
   •   Recommendations #2, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #14, #16, #17, #20, #21, #23, #24 and #29 were partially addressed;
   •   Recommendations #1, #3, #4, #5, #13, #15, #18, #19, #22, #25, #26, #27 and #28 are closed.
 <U+F0FC> It should be noted that some recommendations arising from the OSI 1238 reinforce and reiterate recommendations arising from
   OSI 34-35. The release as per the established deadlines of the deliverables scheduled in Argo 3 project, represents, therefore, a
   further element supporting the conclusion of the Argo 2 recommendations.
 <U+F0FC> In the following slides we presents tables showing the content of the JST communication and the related Bank comments (make
   reference to the last columns of the subsequent tables) taking into account, as explained above, the results achieved within Argo 3
   project.
                                                                                                                                       1

      related quarterly update report will be sent to JST following the BoD approval. Finding #6 is still open only with regards to the
      IT implementations, which due date is 31.12.2018.

Executive Summary (2/2)
 <U+F0FC> With regards to the OSI 34-35 recommendations linked to Finding #1 and #8, it should also be noted that, as indicated by JST in its
   Final Follow-up Letter, the quantitative impacts arising from Finding #1 and #8 would be monitored as part of the communication
   related to the SREP Decision of 19 June 2017 and, as a consequence, they are are not part of Argo 3 project.
 <U+F0FC> The Bank’s answer to the SREP Letter was sent to JST on 2nd March 2018.
 <U+F0FC> In the answer the Bank stated that:
   […] Both on CFR portfolio and on the portfolio subject to Projection, the Bank accounted for, as of December 31, 2017, provisions higher
   than the ones requested by the Osi 1238. These interventions, as requested, has been verified by our external auditors.
   […]
   After the review of the credit classification and assessment policies carried out in 2016 and 2017 and the adjustment to the sale price of
   the bad loans subject to securitization (Valentine transaction), the Bank increased the provisions from January 2016 to December 2017
   (i.e. cost (d)) on the CFR portfolio by about 1.237 €/mln (+284 €/mln vs OSI request) and on the Projection portfolio by about 6.966 €/mln
   (+ 274 €/mln vs OSI request).”
