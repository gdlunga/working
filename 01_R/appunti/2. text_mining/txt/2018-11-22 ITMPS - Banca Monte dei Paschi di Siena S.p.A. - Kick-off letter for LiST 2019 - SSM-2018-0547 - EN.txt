Subject: Participation in the Sensitivity analysis of liquidity risk – stress test 2019
Dear Madam,
Dear Sir,
The European Central bank (ECB), as a competent authority, carries out supervisory stress tests on
                                                1
supervised entities at least annually.
In 2019 the ECB will conduct the Sensitivity analysis of liquidity risk – stress test 2019 (LiST 2019).
This exercise is aimed at evaluating the resilience of banks to an idiosyncratic liquidity shock. Results will
be included in the overall assessment of the 2019 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
Your institution has been selected to participate in the LiST 2019 exercise.
LiST 2019 will be conducted centrally by a dedicated team of supervisors, the LiST team, which will serve
as the main contact point for banks during the exercise. Although the LiST team will draw on the bank-
specific knowledge of the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs), JSTs will not be directly involved in day-to-day
activities.
The ECB has planned for the core phase of the exercise – including relevant interaction with banks – to
take place between February and May 2019. JSTs and banks will discuss individual bank results on a
bilateral basis in the course of the Supervisory Dialogue on SREP 2019.
                                                           ***
We would like to invite your bank to a workshop hosted by the ECB at its premises in Frankfurt am Main
on 6 December 2018 from 09:30 to 14:30 CET. The workshop will include a presentation of the LiST
methodology and process. Your feedback will help the ECB improve the instructions provided to banks,
thereby making it easier for banks to fill in the template.

    See Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 and Article 4(1)(f) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.

                                                                                     ECB-RESTRICTED
We kindly ask you to nominate at least one of your colleagues at the level of director or responsible
project manager to take part in the workshop. Nominated participants should register for the workshop by
30 November 2018, following the instructions included in the Annex. Please note that there may be a
possibility of sending additional delegates to the workshop. Such requests will be accommodated on a
first-come, first-served basis.
                                                    ***
In addition, we kindly ask you to nominate a main contact person and an alternate, whose role will be to
coordinate the exercise on your side. This will involve, among other things, ensuring that the templates
are properly filled in and submitted on time, raising queries and providing clarifications. One contact
person should be available during the exercise at all times. Please provide the contact details of the
designated contact persons via email (suggested title “Contact person for LiST 2019”) to
2019_LiST@ecb.europa.eu by 7 December 2018.
Please also be informed that, during the exercise, the exchange of emails between the ECB and banks
will need to follow the TLS secured protocol. To this end, please check with your IT Department that the
TLS protocol has been implemented for your bank and ensure that the contact person and alternate both
have a TLS email address.
We would like to thank you in advance for your participation in the exercise.
Yours sincerely,
Korbinian Ibel
