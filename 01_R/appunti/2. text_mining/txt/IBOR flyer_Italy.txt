Market Rates Replacement
Managing the transition
October 2018
— The IBOR benchmarks (including LIBOR, EONIA and EURIBOR) have been harshly criticized in the context of
   manipulation scandals over the last few years and a reform is in place aimed at finding the replacement or determining
   revisions for all existing benchmarks and their quotation method.
— The reform involves supranational committees (G20, Financial Supervisory Board), central banks (Working Groups for
   the introduction of alternative benchmarks) and representatives of the banking sector to develop an alternative risk-free
   rate market in conformity with IOSCO principles and the European Benchmark Regulation (BMR). The BMR will enforce
   that as of the 1st of January 2020 only benchmarks that are compliant with these new regulations may be used by EU
   firms in new contracts.
— FCA’s statement that panel banks are no longer compelled to submit LIBOR contributions after 2021 is a trigger for the
   LIBOR Reform.
— The ECB Working group on euro risk-free rates announced its recommendation on 13 September 2018 that ESTER be
   used as the risk-free rate for the euro area. Careful transition planning by market participants is needed to minimize
   disruption to markets and consumers and to safeguard the continuity of contracts to the greatest extent possible, including
   contracts that currently reference a term rate rather than an overnight rate.
  kpmg may support you in this transition with its own methodologies, already put in place
    for other Financial Institutions on the same topic, and leveraging on the insights, studies
             and point of view from the KPMG IBOR Global WG established in early 2018.

Scope of the transition is across all products and all market segments.

In addition, as declared by ECB “Market participants must be made aware the upcoming change will significantly impact a
large part of their activities across the full value chain: commercial product offering, infrastructure, valuation and risk
management, tax, contractual/legal and accounting”.
