 Main elements
 The Compliance Function oversees the respect of all the rules applicable to the Bank as expected from Supervisory Authorities. The Group's
   Internal Control System (see 1030D00793), in accordance with the provisions of the Supervisory Provisions, provides for a systematic
   collaboration between the Corporate Control Functions
 The Policy defines the models and the rules adopted by the Group regarding Compliance coherently with the Group Policy on the Internal
   Controls System (1030D00793) and with the Group Policy on Risk Management (1030D01114). This document defines also rules and models
   related to the Compliance Macro-process, identifies the management methods and the intervention perimeter of the Function.
 Previously, was adopted a decentralized compliance model, that envisaged that the matters with the greatest impact (n. 15 cd. “core”) were
   overseen by the Compliance Function and the remaining (n. 17 cd. “non core”) were delegated to the Specialized Functions
 As part of the activities to adapt to the "New prudential regulatory provisions for banks" the Holding Company has adopted, a "Compliance
   Model" centralized for the Italian Companies identified according to proportionality principles, in relation the complexity of the situations
   and the risks generated, and decentralized for the foreign branch.
   The model follows an approach based on the management of the risk of non-compliance with regard to a business activity.
   In the foreign branch the responsibility for Compliance risk is attributed to specific Compliance Officer.
 In this context, a Group Rule Map has been developed to implement the specific responsibilities of overseeing the regulatory areas. Actually
   the Compliance Function oversees n. 19 matters (“Aree normative”) while n. 2 matters are oversee by Specialized Function.
 Taxonomy of regulatory areas and risk assessment methodology have been standardized for the whole Group.
                                                                                                                                                 3

Organizational setup following the centralization of the group’s Compliance functions
 The new «Centralized Model» for the governance and management of compliance risk provides for the direct supervision of the Compliance Function on the regulatory areas:
          falling within the Bank's scope of operations (with assignment of operating activities to only two specialized structures for the rules on "Health and Safety in the workplace and
             Environmental Protection" and "Tax Compliance");
          relating to the scope of the Group's Italian subsidiaries, subject to Supervision, including the «Consorzio Operativo di Gruppo».
• The services provided to Italian subsidiaries are regulated by specific outsourcing agreements. (BMPS Outsourcing Department quarterly monitors the provision of services and requires
   the quantification of the activities carried out in terms of hours provided for each deliverable envisaged by agreements).
 • For companies characterized by organizational and operational peculiarities (Widiba, MPS Capital Services), the agreements provide for two specific roles:
         «Referente locale della Funzione di compliance», functionally dependent on the Parent Company and has duties assigned by the Supervision (Circ. 285 della Banca d’Italia).
         «Referente cliente» (o referente dell’accordo), which verifies the correct execution of the activities.
 • This provision is also aimed at minimizing the possible "conflicts" between the service providing structure.
                                                                                           Operational modes of coordination

MiFID 2 Regulation

Since 2nd January 2018 the bank complies with MiFID 2 Regulation. In the first months of the year a minority part of the requirements were not
covered by IT solutions; these have been automated during the second quarter of the year.
In particular, with regard to basic advice, the operations carried out by natural and legal persons have been completely centralized on the new
procedure “Advice” on June 9th, with the simultaneous closure of different procedures used before.
With regard to advanced advice, the new adequacy assessment model has been released on July 2nd with the adoption of the same criteria
used in the basic advice and the addition of an adherence control with the model portfolio identified according to the customer's risk Profile.
In order to prepare the personnel of commercial network for the new regulations, various types of traning activities were carried out during the
2017 and in the first months of 2018 (classroom courses, webinars, wbt, video). In addition, the mandatory professional update required by
Consob Regulation n. 20307/2018 began in April (see next slide).
Compliance Function and First Level Control Area have carried out checks on the new rules introduced by the Bank in order to comply with Mifid
2 (slide 12) show the results of the most recent checks). In particular these controls have shown: (1) a still too high frequency of disinvestments
flagged N (non advisable for sale) and (2) the presence of possible attempts to circumvent the cost/benefit control in case of switching
investments. Business Functions and First Level Control Area have been asked to illustrate the initiatives that they intend to adopt in order to
oppose to these conducts.

              CONSOB REGULATION N. 20307/2018 (IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS ON INTERMEDIARIES): PROFESSIONAL UPDATE
 The “professional update” requested by Mifid II will be guaranteed for 2018 through training in mode e-learning. The contents have been entirely
 prepared by the company Prometeia, certified body UNI EN ISO 9001:2008 sector EA37. Even the computer platform that will be used is owned by the
 company Prometeia.
 At the end of the course of 30 hours, participants will be called to conduct in the classroom a test of knowledge and skills. The conduct of the test will be
 supervised by internal personnel.
 Upon passing the test an attestation will be released – in electronic mode – to the participant. The completion of the training is necessary to continue
 providing investment services after 31.12.2018. If the partecipant doesn’t pass the test he/she will continue providing investment services under
 supervision of the senior staff member (supervisor).
 The compliance function is carrying out checks with reference to the provision of the training.

Usury risk exposure – controls put in place (1/4)
  In the field of anti-usury the Bank has put in place the following types of checks:
  - first-level manual ckecks, aimed at assessing that the IT procedures have correctly adopted the threshold rates quarterly published by
    the Ministry of Economy and Finance;
  - first-level IT checks, assessing that the rates applied to individual contracts comply with the anti-usury thresholds;
  - Compliance checks on processes and procedures, aiming at verifying that they comply with the anti-usury legislation.
  With specific regard to these last checks, the Compliance function:
       for each of the 10 credit categories established by the Bank of Italy’s supervisory provisions, periodically randomly selects some
         contracts among those with the highest rates and manually recalculates the percentage rate of charge (Tasso Effettivo Globale –
         TEG) in order to verify that it complies with the anti-usury threshold; then this rate is confronted with the one calculated by the IT
         procedures, so that their proper functioning can be assessed;

Compliance assessment of complaints handling processes and procedures
 Pursuant to Section XI of the Bank of Italy supervisory provisions on banking transparency, the Compliance function periodically assesses
 the adequacy of the procedures and organisational arrangements adopted by the Bank when handling customer complaints.
 More specifically, the Compliance check focusses on such aspects as, for example:
 -   the position of the Complaints function in the organisational structure of the Bank and its qualitative and quantitative dimensioning:
 -   the internal regulations in the field, defining responsibilites, duties and roles in the management of customer complaints;
 -   the IT infrastructure supporting complaints handling.
 Compliance checks in this area were carried both in 2017 and 2018 based on the data quarterly provided by the Complaints function.
 Information on the complaints processing rate and on training initiatives administered to the human resources of the function were also
 taken into account, when assessing the work done by that structure.
                                                                                                                                            18

Organizational setup following the centralization of the group’s Compliance functions
 The new «Centralized Model» for the governance and management of compliance risk provides for the direct supervision of the Compliance Function on the regulatory areas:
          falling within the Bank's scope of operations (with assignment of operating activities to only two specialized structures for the rules on "Health and Safety in the workplace and
             Environmental Protection" and "Tax Compliance");
          relating to the scope of the Group's Italian subsidiaries, subject to Supervision, including the «Consorzio Operativo di Gruppo».
• The services provided to Italian subsidiaries are regulated by specific outsourcing agreements. (BMPS Outsourcing Department quarterly monitors the provision of services and requires
   the quantification of the activities carried out in terms of hours provided for each deliverable envisaged by agreements).
 • For companies characterized by organizational and operational peculiarities (Widiba, MPS Capital Services), the agreements provide for two specific roles:
         «Referente locale della Funzione di compliance», functionally dependent on the Parent Company and has duties assigned by the Supervision (Circ. 285 della Banca d’Italia).
         «Referente cliente» (o referente dell’accordo), which verifies the correct execution of the activities.
 • This provision is also aimed at minimizing the possible "conflicts" between the service providing structure.
                                                                                           Operational modes of coordination

product logic, rather than by the client's needs.
