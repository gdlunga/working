1. Governance, management and control framework: IRRBB Framework
<U+F071> Interest Rate Risk of Banking Book (IRRBB) Framework is the strategic and
  operational structure constituted by the set of formalized and shared processes
  focusing on identification, measurement, management, control and monitoring of
  risk.
<U+F071> The «Direttiva di Gruppo in materia di Gestione del Rischio di Tasso di Interesse
  del Banking Book (IRRBB) - 1030D01508” describes IRRBB Framework according
  to the principles contained in the “Policy in materia di Risk Management (Governo
  dei Rischi) - 1030D01114”.
                                                                                              RAF
<U+F071> IRRBB Framework is consistent with Capital Adequacy Process (ICAAP) under            ICAAP
  normal business and stress conditions and with Risk Appetite Framework process.
                                                                                      IRRBB Risk
<U+F071> The «Direttiva» defines the model adopted by the Group (principles and
  responsibilities) and represents the “mirror" directive on the Risk Management side
  of CFO’s directive.
<U+F071> The process is carried out centrally by the parent company and the responsabilities
  are defined at level of Group for strategic supervision functions, specific
  committees, business function and control functions.
<U+F071>   IRRBB Framework involves regular independent reviews and evaluations by
    Internal Validation Function and Internal Audit.
                                                                                                  3

 Strategic objectives
 The management strategy indicated in the IRRBB strategy approved at the beginning of 2018, has the objective function of supporting
 short-term net interest income (NII) and of benefiting in the medium / long term from the scenario of interest rate plan, expected to rise,
 respecting the risk exposure limits.
 More specifically, main management actions of the risk exposure envisaged by this strategy have the objective of:
 a)  assume a net position of "variable rate payer" and "fixed rate receiver" in the first part of the curve (ie, under 5 years), in compliance
     with the limits from time to time in force, in order to support the contribution to NII in the expectation of short-term interest rates still low
     over the same period;
 b)  in the contrary, assume a net position of "variable rate receiver" and "fixed rate payer" on the longest section of the curve (ie, above 5
     years), on the basis of long-term interest rates on historical levels very low and therefore, expected upward.
 As previously mentioned, the objective remains to position the Banking Book for a future rise in interest rates, limiting the impact on the
 current interest margin and benefiting the Bank's economic value, in compliance with operational management limits.
                                                                                                                                                       12

4. Expected evolution of the IRRBB position also in relation to the funding strategy and market developments
All the hedging actions presented are already included in the Risk Appetite Statement 2018 (RAS) and the related impacts on the income
statement are already included in the 2018 budget and in the 2018-2020 business plan. Consistent with this approach, the main actions on
the IRRBB risk, in the period 2018-2021, are the following:
<U+F071>    Fixed-rate mortgages. Considering that long-term rates are giving the first concrete signs of rising from historical lows and that the
     possibility of future reductions seems to be greatly reduced, IRRBB policy is continuing with the hedging of fixed-rate mortgages, with a
     pct. in the 75%-90% range. The hedges are implemented through interest rate swaps, mainly with forward departures. Spot start may
     also be evaluated, in the future, in order to take advantage of a wider distribution of the cost of hedging on the interest margin, and at
     the same time benefiting for a longer period of time in the event of an effective increase in rates. Rate options may also be used.
<U+F071>    Issues. Coverage in the 80% - 100% range of the newly issued securities liability. The hedging policy maintains a stable level of interest
     rate risk as the securities issued and hedged are characterized by high stability and repurchased at market prices, and replaces short-
     term market funding at variable rates. On 27/9/2018 an integration of the business models for the Banking Book financial portfolio has
     been introduced, including the use of financial assets in the Amortizing Cost category as natural hedging of issues (as an alternative to
     interest rate swaps).
<U+F071>    Commercial liabilities. Coverage in the 50%-75% range of time deposits (so-called CID: Conto italiano di Deposito) of new production
     with a maturity of less than 3/5 years. The hedge aims at maximizing the interest margin on the short-term of the rate curve.
<U+F071>    Financial assets. Coverage of up to 50% of Government Bonds and up to 100% of medium / long-term Government Bonds, expected
     to be purchased as part of the management of the roll-over of the financial assets of the Banking Book.
<U+F071>    TLTRO2. Coverage in the 60% -100% range of the existing TLTRO2. The Bank to date hedged 75% of TLTRO2. It was not necessary
     to proceed with further hedging compared to what was achieved, considering that RAS provides for the possibility of starting the
     repayment of TLTRO2 in advance of the maturity, for an amount of 6.5 bln. (bringing 10 bn to maturity). Since, in the context of the
     RAS, this early repayment represents a possibility but will be assessed over time, the IRRBB policy maintains the possibility to proceed
     with the coverage up to the total of the existing TLTRO2.
                                                                                                                                                13

4. Expected evolution of the IRRBB position also in relation to the funding strategy and market developments
<U+F071>    Fixed-rate/floating-rate embedded options.
      a.   Coverage up to 90% of the cap implicit in variable rate mortgages. The bank has a position on variable rate mortgages, assisted
           by cap. This position origins from loans placed in the years 2009/2010 on an initial nominal value of around Eur 14 billion. Post-
           depreciation and prepayments, the residual amount is now about EUR 8.3 bn. To date, the amount of hedging is 36% of the
           nominal amount, which is adequate to cover the risk of this component, considering several elements: a) the strike of mortgages,
           mostly concentrated in the 3.5% / 4% area of <U+200B>short-term interest rates (1/6 months), is significantly out-of-the-money; b) the bank
           has gradually assumed a "long-term" position (gains if rates rise). In the event of a significant rise in rates, the implicit caps in
           mortgages should gradually reduce this "long" position, effectively reducing the sensitivity to interest rates, at much higher levels;
           c) historically, the levels of short-term rates (3/6 months), since the birth of the Euro, have risen above 4% on a few occasions
           and for limited periods of time (2001/2002 and 2007/2008). This tail risk will in any case always be monitored / assessed and
           prudentially, within the RAS, the possibility of realizing an additional coverage is included.
      b.   Up to 100% coverage of 0% floor strikes implicit in variable rate mortgages, both in stock and new production. The bank has a
           "long" position of 0% floor on the indexing parameter of variable rate mortgages, placed in particular starting from 2016 for a
           nominal value as at 31.12.2017 of approximately Eur 4.1 billion. Considering the expected scenario and the minimum level
           reached by interest rates, this value may be optimized in terms of greater net interest income, covering on the market part of the
           exposure already in place and of expected production.
Finally, analysis is underway, and a further possible intervention can therefore be carried out in the following area:
a) re-fixing risk on the Euribor indices where the Bank is exposed in June and December to the re-pricing on the Euribor 6m index
underlying the items of the variable rate commercial asset. This risk can be shifted to shorter maturity indices and with re-pricing dates
diluted during the year, to obtain a more stable margin of interest profile. The possibility of managing the basis risk deriving from the
mismatch of the indices underlying the commercial floating rate assets under hedge accounting will be assessed as soon as the details of
IFRS9 for the management of the interest rate risk of the banking book are disclosed.

4: Update of the IRRBB strategy
The tables below describe the activities carried out in the course of 2018, in line with the IRRBB strategy in force. In the following page is
possible to observe how both the sensitivity of economic value and of net interest income have essentially stabilized and finally, the
breakdown of the sensitivities along the time shows the overall positioning achieved by the banking book and how it would be in the
absence of any hedge.

4: Update of the IRRBB strategy
The above activities will have a prospective impact both on income and on risk measures, with particular reference to the Bank's positioning with respect to the
interest rate risk. In order to assess its possible impact, the realization of these activities up to the maximum permitted levels was assumed, calculating the
impact on prospective income and risk measures.
This prospective income impact may be represented, at the aggregate level, looking at the impact on the delta EVE of the envisaged hedges. The table below
shows the delta EVE (sensitivity of the economic value) for different variations in interest rates, on the right in the hypothesis of absence of coverage; on the left
in case the covers are made. In particular, in orange the case of an increase in rates of +25 bps is highlighted. The tables show how, in the absence of coverage,
the Bank quickly returns to a "short rate" position, while in case of realization of the covers, the position remains "long rate" however gradually decreasing over
time (in correspondence with the increase in expected rates).
The graphs below moreover represent the realized sensitivity both on EVE and on NII for an increase of +25 bps in interest rates. From the graphs it may be
appreciated that the Bank maintains a positive sensitivity to an increase in interest rates, both on EVE and on NII.
