            Con lettera del 31 Luglio u.s. (cfr. Allegato 1) la BCE ha inviato all’attenzione del
            Consiglio di Amministrazione della Banca un aggiornamento sul processo TRIM
            investigation (ispezioni on-site) , che sta entrando nella seconda fase di attuazione,

            dedicata alla valutazione dei modelli utilizzati per valutare il rischio di credito per i
            portafogli low default. A livello di sistema tale fase verrà avviata nel periodo
            compreso tra Settembre 2018 e Giugno 2019 e sarà estesa progressivamente a tre

            classi di esposizioni: imprese - altri, istituzioni, imprese - credito specializzato.
            La lettera in oggetto informa che, per la nostra Banca, l’ avvio della TRIM
            investigation sui portafogli low default non avverrà nel corso del 2018. Ci possiamo
            pertanto attendere un avvio nel corso della prima metà del 2019, preceduto da una
          MEnotifica di avvio ispezione intorno a fine Dicembre 2018/Gennaio 2019. La lettera
            ricevuta indica peraltro le specifiche logistiche e organizzative che gli Enti ispezionati
            devono assicurare per la buona esecuzione della TRIM investigation.

 Status update on TRIM: organisation of upcoming “low-default portfolio” investigations
 Dear Sir or Madam,
 I am following up on my previous letter, dated 11 June 2018, to provide you with further information about the
 planning of the upcoming TRIM investigations relating to “low-default portfolios”, which will start in September
                                                                NE
 2018. I would also like to update you on the consultation process for the ECB guide to internal models
 (hereinafter “the guide”).
 Status update on TRIM and overview of upcoming low-default portfolio investigations
                                                     IO                                     1
 Phase one of the execution of the project has been successfully completed . Since the start of on-site TRIM
 investigations in April 2017, 115 on-site investigations have been finalised across 12 countries, and the
 corresponding supervisory decisions are being sent to banks. Once again, let me take the opportunity to
 praise the excellent collaboration with your institution in this first phase of TRIM.
            ME
 With the start of phase two of the TRIM execution approaching, all the preparatory activities are currently
 being finalised.
 The phase two investigations have been planned to take place in three progressive and partly overlapping
              NT
 waves, starting between September 2018 and mid-2019, according to the exposure class in scope of the
 investigation:
     1. Corporates – Other
                AZ
     2. Institutions
     3. Corporates – Specialised lending
 This will facilitate the subsequent horizontal analysis and peer comparison of the results of the investigations.
 The specific models in the scope of the TRIM low-default portfolio investigations have been selected on the
 basis of predefined criteria reflecting the materiality and criticality of the individual models and drawing on
 CU
 1
   The execution of the project can be divided in two key phases: (i) phase one (2017-Q2 2018) involves a review of the models
 used to assess the credit risk for retail and small and medium-sized enterprise portfolios, as well as market risk and counterparty
DO
 credit risk; (ii) phase two (Q3 2018-2019) mainly focuses on the models used to assess the credit risk for low-default portfolios.

 Lastly, the required organisational and logistical set-up will remain largely unchanged with respect to phase
 one. Institutions will be notified about 8 weeks before the start of the investigation through a letter from the
 ECB and, around the same time, will receive in a separate communication the corresponding data request.
 Please refer to Annex 2 for the detailed organisational and logistical requirements, and do not hesitate to

 The public consultation for the general topics chapter of the guide was concluded on 28 May 2018. I would
 like to thank all bank representatives who took part in the consultation by attending the public hearing on 18
 April or submitting comments. The comments are now being reviewed with a view to finalise this chapter of
                                                                                   T

 The other chapters of the guide relating to credit risk, market risk and counterparty credit risk are currently
 being updated, benefiting from the outcomes and horizontal analyses of the corresponding investigations.
 They will also be put out for consultation in the coming months.
 Next steps

 As mentioned above, the final preparations for the new waves of TRIM investigations on low-default portfolio
 models (see Annex 1) are well advanced and the first investigations are about to start. I trust that this letter

 We would like to clarify the logistical and organisational requirements for the upcoming TRIM investigations
 (TRIMIs). Institutions are expected to have an adequate internal organisational structure in place to ensure
 the successful execution of the TRIMIs. We therefore expect a high availability of internal stakeholders
 involved in internal models (including internal model experts, managers responsible for validation, IT experts,
                                                                          CO
 business area managers and internal audit) during the execution phase of the TRIMIs. We also expect
 responses to TRIM data and information requests to be of a high quality.

 The on-site team will use this equipment to run common pre-defined inspection tools, which will be
 temporarily transferred to these computers. If your IT security processes require any check in advance,   O
 please inform the TRIM PMO (TRIM_PMO@ecb.europa.eu).
 Data and information to be prepared or submitted                                               AT
 A data request has been prepared for the models for “low-default portfolios” selected for review. Specific
 information will be requested from institutions ahead of each TRIMI to ensure efficient preparation and
                                                                    CO
 provide all teams with the same information before the start of their assessment.
 The submission of the data to the ECB and the assessment team follows the process established for phase
 one of the project execution. The data request covers the models under the scope of the investigation and
 leverages the existing TRIM data request used for phase one, with additional data fields or information
                                                                       MI
 requests specifically for the new models in scope of the reviews. The data request takes into due
 consideration the minimum data and information that are needed to estimate the risk parameters, hence no
 new data needs to be created ad hoc to complete the TRIM templates. On the contrary, it is expected that
                                                                          T
 institutions will, wherever possible, map currently available information to the data request.
 Dispatch of data request templates
 The data request templates will be shared with your Institution about eight weeks before the start of the
 investigation, and the communication will also clarify the exact models in scope.
                                                          NE
 Delivery of data and/or information requested in two steps
 1. The first subset of the data related specifically to the PD request (“aggregated data”) should be delivered
    directly to TRIM PMO through the dedicated Brainloop virtual data room (VDR) between the ECB and
                                                IO
    your Institution. This should be done four weeks in advance of the start of the mission (the date of
    which will be specified in the bank’s notification letter);
 2. The remaining data and/or information requested should be made available to the Head of Mission on
          ME
    the institution’s IT equipment one week before the start of the TRIM investigation. This concerns data
    requests for PD and LGD, as well as information on rating assignment for a sub-set of obligors and
    information regarding IRB data quality.
 Further details on the data and/or information to be prepared or submitted by your institution are set out in
            NT
 the instructions included in the respective templates.
