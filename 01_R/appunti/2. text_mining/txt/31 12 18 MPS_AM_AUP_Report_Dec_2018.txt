                                                                                              APPENDIX I
PROCEDURES REQUIRED IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE ARITHMETIC ACCURACY OF THE
CALCULATIONS PROVIDED UNDER THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST
(A)   Verification of the arithmetical accuracy of the Asset Coverage Test calculation resulting from the
      Pre-Issuer Default Monthly Test Performance Report with reference to the frequency specified in
      accordance with the Asset Monitor Agreement.
(B)   The verification of the arithmetic accuracy of the Asset Coverage Test calculation shall comprise
      the following steps:
      1)       Obtain from the Pre-Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent the Pre-Issuer Default Monthly
               Test Performance Report including the calculation parameters specified below, which are
               necessary to the conduct of the Asset Coverage Test:
               A, X, B, C, Z, Y, W, OBG (as defined in the Cover Pool Management Agreement).
      2)       Re-performing the calculation: A-X+B+C-Z-Y-W = OBG
      3)       Comparison between the result obtained thereby and the result provided by the Pre-
               Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent
      4)        Reporting of any discrepancies
(C)   With reference to the calculation parameters:
        <U+F0B7>      Obtaining from the Principal Servicer a schedule with the detail of the components of
               figure B (principal available funds) and tracing the amount of such components to the
               relevant servicer report and report any discrepancies.
        <U+F0B7>      Check that the amount of figure A derives from the application of the formula MIN
               (which is the sum of the LTV Adjusted Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan in the
               Cover Pool) * AP (each of MIN, LTV, Adjusted Principal Balance and AP as defined in the
               Cover Pool Management Agreement) to the figures included in the electronic file
               containing the details of the loan portfolio, provided by the Pre-Issuer Default Test
               Calculation Agent.
      The procedure under (C) above will be performed only on a semiannual basis and with reference
      to the first Performance Test Report.
PROCEDURES REQUIRED IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE ARITHMETIC ACCURACY OF THE
CALCULATIONS UNDER THE MANDATORY TESTS
(A)   Verification of the arithmetical accuracy of the Mandatory Tests' calculation, as shown in the Pre-
      Issuer Default Test Performance Report with reference to the Quarterly Test Calculation date
      frequency specified in accordance with the Asset Monitor Agreement.
(B)   The verification of the arithmetical accuracy of the Mandatory Tests' calculation shall comprise
      the following steps:
      1)       Obtaining from the Pre-Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent the relevant Pre-Issuer
               Default Quarterly Test Performance Report, including the calculation parameters
               specified below, which are necessary to the conduct of the Mandatory Tests:
                Nominal Value Test
                         A, B, OBG (as defined in the Cover Pool Management Agreement)

                                                                                          2
         Net Present Value Test
                 A, B, C, D, NPVOBG (as defined in the Cover Pool Management Agreement)
         Interest Coverage Test
                 A, B, C, D, E, IOBG (as defined in the Cover Pool Management Agreement)
2)       Re-performing the calculations on the basis of the following formulae:
                   Test                                            Formula
Nominal Value Test                          A + B = OBG
Net Present Value Test                      A+B+C-D = NPVOBG
Interest Coverage Test                      (A+B+C+D-E) = IOBG
3)       Comparison between the result obtained thereby and the result provided by the Pre-
         Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent
4)       Reporting of any discrepancies

                                                                                                 APPENDIX II
With respect to the procedures requested in order to verify the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations
under the Asset Coverage Test:
    a)  We obtained from the Pre-Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent the Monthly Test Performance
        Reports at each relevant report date – including the calculation parameters necessary to the
        conduct of the Asset Coverage Test. We noted that the Pre-Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent
        provided the amount of parameter A as (MIN*AP). The relevant report dates and the parameters
        are detailed in Table 1.
    b)  We re-performed the calculation: A-X+B+C-Z-Y-W = OBG.
    c)  We compared the results obtained thereby and the results provided by the Pre-Issuer Default
        Test Calculation Agent, noting agreement.
    d)  With reference to the Monthly Test Performance Report as at July 31, 2018:
          d.1)   we compared the amount of figure B (principal available funds) with the corresponding
                 amount set forth in the schedule (containing the detail of the components of such
                 figure) provided by the Principal Servicer. In particular we compared, noting agreement,
                 the amount of figure B with the amount resulting from the sum of the principal available
                 funds set forth in the Monthly Test Performance Report as at June 30, 2018 with the
                 total principal collections resulting in the Monthly Servicer Report as at July 31, 2018.
          d.2)   we checked that the amount of figure A (equal to MIN*AP) derives from the application
                 of the formula MIN (which is the sum of the LTV Adjusted Principal Balance of each
                 Mortgage Loan in the Cover Pool) * AP (each of MIN, LTV, Adjusted Principal Balance
                 and AP as defined in the Cover Pool Management Agreement) by comparing such
                 formula with the corresponding formula contained in the file named “Mutui
                 disaggregati.xls” at the date of July 31, 2018 provided by the Pre-Issuer Default Test
                 Calculation Agent, noting agreement.

With respect to the procedures requested in order to verify the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations under
the Mandatory Tests:
    a)  We obtained from the Pre-Issuer Default Test Calculation Agent the Quarterly Test Performance
